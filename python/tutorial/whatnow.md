Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?

This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:

- <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index" class="reference internal"><span class="std std-ref">The Python Standard Library</span></a>:

  You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a _lot_ of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, write CGI programs, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.

- <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index" class="reference internal"><span class="std std-ref">Installing Python Modules</span></a> explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.

- <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index" class="reference internal"><span class="std std-ref">The Python Language Reference</span></a>: A detailed explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.

More Python resources:

- <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="reference external">https://www.python.org</a>: The major Python Web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the Web. This Web site is mirrored in various places around the world, such as Europe, Japan, and Australia; a mirror may be faster than the main site, depending on your geographical location.

- <a href="https://docs.python.org/" class="reference external">https://docs.python.org</a>: Fast access to Python’s documentation.

- <a href="https://pypi.org/" class="reference external">https://pypi.org</a>: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop <a href="#id2" id="id1" class="footnote-reference brackets">1</a>, is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.

- <a href="https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/" class="reference external">https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/</a>: The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules, and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)

- <a href="http://www.pyvideo.org/" class="reference external">http://www.pyvideo.org</a> collects links to Python-related videos from conferences and user-group meetings.

- <a href="https://scipy.org/" class="reference external">https://scipy.org</a>: The Scientific Python project includes modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers, random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.

For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the newsgroup _comp.lang.python_, or send them to the mailing list at <a href="mailto:python-list%40python.org" class="reference external">python-list<span>@</span>python<span>.</span>org</a>. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be forwarded to the other. There are hundreds of postings a day, asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules. Mailing list archives are available at <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/" class="reference external">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/</a>.

Before posting, be sure to check the list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/index.html#faq-index" class="reference internal"><span class="std std-ref">Frequently Asked Questions</span></a> (also called the FAQ). The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.

Footnotes

“Cheese Shop” is a Monty Python’s sketch: a customer enters a cheese shop, but whatever cheese he asks for, the clerk says it’s missing.
