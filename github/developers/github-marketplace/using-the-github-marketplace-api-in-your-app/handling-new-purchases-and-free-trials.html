      If you offer a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} in {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, your app must identify users
      following the OAuth authorization flow. You don’t need to set up a
      separate {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} to support this
      flow. See “<a
        href="/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/"
        >Identifying and authorizing users for {% data
        variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}</a
      >” for more information.

    <h2 id="step-1.-initial-purchase-and-webhook-event">
      Step 1. Initial purchase and webhook event
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before a customer purchases your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} app, they select a
      <a href="/marketplace/selling-your-app/github-marketplace-pricing-plans/"
        >listing plan</a
      >. They also choose whether to purchase the app from their personal
      account or an organization account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customer completes the purchase by clicking
      <strong>Complete order and begin installation</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} then sends the
      <a href="/webhooks/event-payloads/#marketplace_purchase"
        ><code>marketplace_purchase</code></a
      >
      webhook with the <code>purchased</code> action to your app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the <code>effective_date</code> and
      <code>marketplace_purchase</code> object from the
      <code>marketplace_purchase</code> webhook to determine which plan the
      customer purchased, when the billing cycle starts, and when the next
      billing cycle begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your app offers a free trial, read the
      <code>marketplace_purchase[on_free_trial]</code> attribute from the
      webhook. If the value is <code>true</code>, your app will need to track
      the free trial start date (<code>effective_date</code>) and the date the
      free trial ends (<code>free_trial_ends_on</code>). Use the
      <code>free_trial_ends_on</code> date to display the remaining days left in
      a free trial in your app’s UI. You can do this in either a banner or in
      your
      <a
        href="/marketplace/selling-your-app/billing-customers-in-github-marketplace/#providing-billing-services-in-your-apps-ui"
        >billing UI</a
      >. To learn how to handle cancellations before a free trial ends, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/handling-plan-cancellations"
        >Handling plan cancellations</a
      >.” See “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/handling-plan-changes"
        >Handling plan changes</a
      >” to find out how to transition a free trial to a paid plan when a free
      trial expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      See “<a
        href="/marketplace/integrating-with-the-github-marketplace-api/github-marketplace-webhook-events/"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhook events</a
      >” for an example of the <code>marketplace_purchase</code> event payload.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-2.-installation">Step 2. Installation</h2>
    <p>
      If your app is a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} prompts the customer to select which
      repositories the app can access when they purchase it. {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} then installs the app on the account the
      customer selected and grants access to the selected repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, if you specified a <strong>Setup URL</strong> in your {%
      data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} settings, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} will redirect the customer to that URL.
      If you do not specify a setup URL, you will not be able to handle
      purchases of your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Setup URL</strong> is described as
      optional in {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} settings, but
      it is a required field if you want to offer your app in {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      If your app is an {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} does not install it anywhere. Instead,
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} redirects the customer to the
      <strong>Installation URL</strong> you specified in your
      <a
        href="/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/writing-github-marketplace-listing-descriptions/#listing-urls"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a customer purchases an {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app
      %}, {% data variables.product.product_name %} redirects the customer to
      the URL you choose (either Setup URL or Installation URL) and the URL
      includes the customer’s selected pricing plan as a query parameter:
      <code>marketplace_listing_plan_id</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-3.-authorization">Step 3. Authorization</h2>
    <p>
      When a customer purchases your app, you must send the customer through the
      OAuth authorization flow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your app is a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %},
          begin the authorization flow as soon as {% data
          variables.product.product_name %} redirects the customer to the
          <strong>Setup URL</strong>. Follow the steps in “<a
            href="/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/"
            >Identifying and authorizing users for {% data
            variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}</a
          >.”
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your app is an {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %},
          begin the authorization flow as soon as {% data
          variables.product.product_name %} redirects the customer to the
          <strong>Installation URL</strong>. Follow the steps in “<a
            href="/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/"
            >Authorizing {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}</a
          >.”
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For either type of app, the first step is to redirect the customer to
      https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the customer completes the authorization, your app receives an OAuth
      access token for the customer. You’ll need this token for the next step.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When authorizing a customer on a free trial, grant
      them the same access they would have on the paid plan. You’ll move them to
      the paid plan after the trial period ends.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <h2 id="step-4.-provisioning-customer-accounts">
      Step 4. Provisioning customer accounts
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your app must provision a customer account for all new purchases. Using
      the access token you received for the customer in
      <a href="#step-3-authorization">Step 3. Authorization</a>, call the “<a
        href="/rest/reference/apps#list-subscriptions-for-the-authenticated-user"
        >List subscriptions for the authenticated user</a
      >” endpoint. The response will include the customer’s
      <code>account</code> information and show whether they are on a free trial
      (<code>on_free_trial</code>). Use this information to complete setup and
      provisioning.
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-double-purchases %}</p>
    <p>
      If the purchase is for an organization and per-user, you can prompt the
      customer to choose which organization members will have access to the
      purchased app.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can customize the way that organization members receive access to your
      app. Here are a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flat-rate pricing:</strong> If the purchase is made for an
      organization using flat-rate pricing, your app can
      <a href="/rest/reference/orgs#list-organization-members"
        >get all the organization’s members</a
      >
      via the API and prompt the organization admin to choose which members will
      have paid users on the integrator side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Per-unit pricing:</strong> One method of provisioning per-unit
      seats is to allow users to occupy a seat as they log in to the app. Once
      the customer hits the seat count threshold, your app can alert the user
      that they need to upgrade through {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
