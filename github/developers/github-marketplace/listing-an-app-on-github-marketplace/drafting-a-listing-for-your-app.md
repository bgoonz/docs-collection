## Create a new draft {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing

You can only create draft listings for apps that are public. Before creating your draft listing, you can read the following guidelines for writing and configuring settings in your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing:

* [Writing {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing descriptions](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/writing-github-marketplace-listing-descriptions/)
* [Setting a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing's pricing plan](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/setting-a-github-marketplace-listing-s-pricing-plan/)
* [Configuring the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} Webhook](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/configuring-the-github-marketplace-webhook/)

To create a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing:

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.developer_settings %}
3. In the left sidebar, click either **OAuth Apps** or **GitHub Apps** depending on the app you're adding to {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

  {% note %}

  **Note**: You can also add a listing by navigating to https://github.com/marketplace/new, viewing your available apps, and clicking **Create draft listing**.

  {% endnote %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.edit_marketplace_listing %}
5. Once you've created a new draft listing, you'll see an overview of the sections that you'll need to visit before your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing will be complete.

{% note %}

**Note:** In the "Contact info" section of your listing, we recommend using individual email addresses, rather than group emails addresses like support@domain.com. GitHub will use these email addresses to contact you about updates to {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} that might affect your listing, new feature releases, marketing opportunities, payouts, and information on conferences and sponsorships.

{% endnote %}

## Editing your listing

Once you've created a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} draft listing, you can come back to modify information in your listing anytime. If your app is already approved and in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, you can edit the information and images in your listing, but you will not be able to change existing published pricing plans. See "[Setting a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing's pricing plan](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/setting-a-github-marketplace-listing-s-pricing-plan/)."

## Submitting your app

Once you've completed your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing, you can submit your listing for review from the **Overview** page. You'll need to read and accept the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} Developer Agreement](/articles/github-marketplace-developer-agreement/)," and then you can click **Submit for review**. After you submit your app for review, an onboarding expert will contact you with additional information about the onboarding process.

## Removing a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing

If you no longer want to list your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %} to remove your listing.
