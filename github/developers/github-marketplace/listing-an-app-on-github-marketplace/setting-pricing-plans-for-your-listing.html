    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} offers several different
      types of pricing plans. For detailed information, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/pricing-plans-for-github-marketplace-apps"
        >Pricing plans for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To offer a paid plan for your app, your app must be owned by an
      organization that has completed the publisher verification process and met
      certain criteria. For more information, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a
      >” and “<a
        href="/marketplace/getting-started/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/"
        >Requirements for listing an app on {% data
        variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If your app is already published with a paid plan and you’re a verified
      publisher, then you can publish a new paid plan from the “Edit a pricing
      plan” page in your Marketplace app listing settings.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your app is already published with a paid plan and but you are not a
      verified publisher, then you can cannot publish a new paid plan until you
      are a verified publisher. For more information about becoming a verified
      publisher, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a

    </p>
    <h2 id="about-saving-pricing-plans">About saving pricing plans</h2>
    <p>
      You can save pricing plans in a draft or published state. If you haven’t
      submitted your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing
      for approval, a published plan will function in the same way as a draft
      plan until your listing is approved and shown on {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. Draft plans allow you to create
      and save new pricing plans without making them available on your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing page. Once you publish a
      pricing plan on a published listing, it’s available for customers to
      purchase immediately. You can publish up to 10 pricing plans.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="creating-pricing-plans">Creating pricing plans</h2>
    <p>
      To create a pricing plan for your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing, click
      <strong>Plans and pricing</strong> in the left sidebar of your
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/manage"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing page</a
      >. For more information, see “<a
        href="/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/creating-a-draft-github-marketplace-listing/"
        >Creating a draft {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}
        listing</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click <strong>New draft plan</strong>, you’ll see a form that
      allows you to customize your pricing plan. You’ll need to configure the
      following fields to create a pricing plan:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan name</strong> - Your pricing plan’s name will appear on
          your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} app’s landing
          page. You can customize the name of your pricing plan to align with
          the plan’s resources, the size of the company that will use the plan,
          or anything you’d like.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pricing models</strong> - There are three types of pricing
          plan: free, flat-rate, and per-unit. All plans require you to process
          new purchase and cancellation events from the marketplace API. In
          addition, for paid plans:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You must set a price for both monthly and yearly subscriptions in US
            dollars.
          </li>
          <li>Your app must process plan change events.</li>
          <li>
            You must request verification to publish a listing with a paid plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            {% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-pricing-free-trials %}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For detailed information, see “<a
            href="/developers/github-marketplace/pricing-plans-for-github-marketplace-apps"
            >Pricing plans for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}
            apps</a
          >” and “<a

            your app</a

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Available for</strong> - {% data
          variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} pricing plans can apply to
          <strong>Personal and organization accounts</strong>,
          <strong>Personal accounts only</strong>, or
          <strong>Organization accounts only</strong>. For example, if your
          pricing plan is per-unit and provides multiple seats, you would select
          <strong>Organization accounts only</strong> because there is no way to
          assign seats to people in an organization from a personal account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Short description</strong> - Write a brief summary of the
          details of the pricing plan. The description might include the type of
          customer the plan is intended for or the resources the plan includes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Bullets</strong> - You can write up to four bullets that
          include more details about your pricing plan. The bullets might
          include the use cases of your app or list more detailed information
          about the resources or features included in the plan.

      Changing a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing’s

    <p>
      If a pricing plan for your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace
      %} listing is no longer needed, or if you need to adjust pricing details,
      you can remove it.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Once you publish a pricing plan for an app that is already listed in {%
      data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, you can’t make changes to
      the plan. Instead, you’ll need to remove the pricing plan and create a new
      plan. Customers who already purchased the removed pricing plan will
      continue to use it until they opt out and move onto a new pricing plan.
      For more on pricing plans, see “<a
        href="/marketplace/selling-your-app/github-marketplace-pricing-plans/"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} pricing plans</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you remove a pricing plan, users won’t be able to purchase your app
      using that plan. Existing users on the removed pricing plan will continue
      to stay on the plan until they cancel their plan subscription.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> {% data variables.product.product_name %} can’t
      remove users from a removed pricing plan. You can run a campaign to
      encourage users to upgrade or downgrade from the removed pricing plan onto
      a new pricing plan.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      You can disable GitHub Marketplace free trials without retiring the
      pricing plan, but this prevents you from initiating future free trials for
      that plan. If you choose to disable free trials for a pricing plan, users
      already signed up can complete their free trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      After retiring a pricing plan, you can create a new pricing plan with the
      same name as the removed pricing plan. For instance, if you have a “Pro”
      pricing plan but need to change the flat rate price, you can remove the
      “Pro” pricing plan and create a new “Pro” pricing plan with an updated
      price. Users will be able to purchase the new pricing plan immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not a verified publisher, then you cannot change a pricing plan
      for your app. For more information about becoming a verified publisher,
      see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a
