<h2 id="understanding-the-billing-cycle">Understanding the billing cycle</h2>
<p>Customers can choose a monthly or yearly billing cycle when they purchase your app. All changes customers make to the billing cycle and plan selection will trigger a <code>marketplace_purchase</code> event. You can refer to the <code>marketplace_purchase</code> webhook payload to see which billing cycle a customer selects and when the next billing date begins (<code>effective_date</code>). For more information about webhook payloads, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/webhook-events-for-the-github-marketplace-api">Webhook events for the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="providing-billing-services-in-your-apps-ui">Providing billing services in your app’s UI</h2>
<p>Customers should be able to perform the following actions from your app’s website: - Customers should be able to modify or cancel their {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} plans for personal and organizational accounts separately. {% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-billing-ui-requirements %}</p>
<h2 id="billing-services-for-upgrades-downgrades-and-cancellations">Billing services for upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations</h2>
<p>Follow these guidelines for upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations to maintain a clear and consistent billing process. For more detailed instructions about the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app">Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app</a>.”</p>
<p>You can use the <code>marketplace_purchase</code> webhook’s <code>effective_date</code> key to determine when a plan change will occur and periodically synchronize the <a href="/rest/reference/apps#list-accounts-for-a-plan">List accounts for a plan</a>.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h3>
<p>When a customer upgrades their pricing plan or changes their billing cycle from monthly to yearly, you should make the change effective for them immediately. You need to apply a pro-rated discount to the new plan and change the billing cycle.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-failed-purchase-event %}</p>
<p>For information about building upgrade and downgrade workflows into your app, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/handling-plan-changes">Handling plan changes</a>.”</p>
<h3 id="downgrades-and-cancellations">Downgrades and cancellations</h3>
<p>Downgrades occur when a customer moves to a free plan from a paid plan, selects a plan with a lower cost than their current plan, or changes their billing cycle from yearly to monthly. When downgrades or cancellations occur, you don’t need to provide a refund. Instead, the current plan will remain active until the last day of the current billing cycle. The <code>marketplace_purchase</code> event will be sent when the new plan takes effect at the beginning of the customer’s next billing cycle.</p>
<p>When a customer cancels a plan, you must: - Automatically downgrade them to the free plan, if it exists.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.marketplace.cancellation-clarification %} - Enable them to upgrade the plan through GitHub if they would like to continue the plan at a later time.</p>
<p>For information about building cancellation workflows into your app, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/handling-plan-cancellations">Handling plan cancellations</a>.”</p>
