      {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} pricing plans can be
      free, flat rate, or per-unit. Prices are set, displayed, and processed in
      US dollars. Paid plans are restricted to apps published by verified
      publishers. For more information about becoming a verified publisher, see
      “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Customers purchase your app using a payment method attached to their {%
      data variables.product.product_name %} account, without having to leave {%
      data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. You don’t have to
      write code to perform billing transactions, but you will have to handle
      events from the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app"
        >Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your
        app</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If the app you’re listing on {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} has multiple plan options, you
      can set up corresponding pricing plans. For example, if your app has two
      plan options, an open source plan and a pro plan, you can set up a free
      pricing plan for your open source plan and a flat pricing plan for your
      pro plan. Each {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing
      must have an annual and a monthly price for every plan that’s listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on how to create a pricing plan, see “<a
        href="/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/setting-a-github-marketplace-listing-s-pricing-plan/"
        >Setting a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing’s
        pricing plan</a
      >.”

    <h3 id="free-pricing-plans">Free pricing plans</h3>
    <p>{% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}</p>
    <p>
      Free plans are completely free for users. If you set up a free pricing
      plan, you cannot charge users that choose the free pricing plan for the
      use of your app. You can create both free and paid plans for your listing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All apps need to handle events for new purchases and cancellations. Apps
      that only have free plans do not need to handle events for free trials,
      upgrades, and downgrades. For more information, see: “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app"
        >Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your
        app</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If you add a paid plan to an app that you’ve already listed in {% data
      variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} as a free service, you’ll need
      to request verification for the app and go through financial onboarding.
    </p>
    <h3 id="paid-pricing-plans">Paid pricing plans</h3>
    <p>There are two types of paid pricing plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Flat rate pricing plans charge a set fee on a monthly and yearly
          basis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Per-unit pricing plans charge a set fee on either a monthly or yearly
          basis for a unit that you specify. A “unit” can be anything you’d like
          (for example, a user, seat, or person).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may also want to offer free trials. These provide free, 14-day trials
      of OAuth or GitHub Apps to customers. When you set up a Marketplace
      pricing plan, you can select the option to provide a free trial for
      flat-rate or per-unit pricing plans.
    </p>
    <h2 id="free-trials">Free trials</h2>
    <p>
      Customers can start a free trial for any paid plan on a Marketplace
      listing that includes free trials. However, customers cannot create more
      than one free trial per marketplace product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free trials have a fixed length of 14 days. Customers are notified 4 days
      before the end of their trial period (on day 11 of the free trial) that
      their plan will be upgraded. At the end of a free trial, customers will be
      auto-enrolled into the plan they are trialing if they do not cancel.
    </p>

    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> GitHub expects you to delete any private customer
      data within 30 days of a cancelled trial, beginning at the receipt of the
      cancellation event.
