    <p>
      After your {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing for
      an app with a paid plan is created and approved, you’ll provide payment
      details to {% data variables.product.product_name %} as part of the
      financial onboarding process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your revenue reaches a minimum of $500 US dollars for the month,
      you’ll receive an electronic payment from {% data
      variables.product.company_short %}. This will be the income from
      marketplace transactions minus the amount charged by {% data
      variables.product.company_short %} to cover their running costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For transactions made before January 1, 2021, {% data
      variables.product.company_short %} retains 25% of transaction income. For
      transactions made after that date, only 5% is retained by {% data
      variables.product.company_short %}. This change will be reflected in
      payments received from the end of January 2021 onward.
