      Certain apps on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} have
      the {% octicon “verified” aria-label=“The verified badge” %} badge and a
      tooltip that says “Publisher domain and email verified”. This means that
      the app is owned by an organization that has:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Verified ownership of their domain and has a verified badge on their
        profile
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirmed their email address so {% data
        variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Support can reach the organization
      </li>
      <li>
        Required two-factor authentication for their organization. For more
        information, see “<a
          href="/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization"
          >Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization</a
        >.”

      {% note %} {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} does not analyze
      the app. The marketplace badge {% octicon “verified” aria-label=“The
      verified badge” %} only confirms that the publisher meets the requirements
      listed above. {% endnote %}

    <p>
      To learn how you can add this badge to your app, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a
      >.”

    <p>
      Some apps on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} have
      the {% octicon “verified” aria-label=“The verified badge” %} badge and a
      tooltip that says “App meets the requirements for listing” instead of,
      “Publisher domain and email verified.” This means that the app meets the
      listing requirements described in “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app"
        >Requirements for listing an app</a
      >,” but the publisher has not been verified, as described in “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization"
        >Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a
      >”. Apps with this badge cannot change their pricing plan until the
      publisher successfully applies for verification.

      Actions with the {% octicon “verified” aria-label=“The verified badge” %},
