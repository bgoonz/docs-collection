## For GitHub Apps

Certain apps on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} have the {% octicon "verified" aria-label="The verified badge" %} badge and a tooltip that says "Publisher domain and email verified". This means that the app is owned by an organization that has:

- Verified ownership of their domain and has a verified badge on their profile
- Confirmed their email address so {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Support can reach the organization
- Required two-factor authentication for their organization. For more information, see "[Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)."

{% note %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} does not analyze the app. The marketplace badge {% octicon "verified" aria-label="The verified badge" %} only confirms that the publisher meets the requirements listed above.
{% endnote %}

To learn how you can add this badge to your app, see "[Applying for publisher verification for your organization](/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization)."

Some apps on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} have the {% octicon "verified" aria-label="The verified badge" %} badge and a tooltip that says "App meets the requirements for listing" instead of, "Publisher domain and email verified." This means that the app meets the listing requirements described in "[Requirements for listing an app](/developers/github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app)," but the publisher has not been verified, as described in "[Applying for publisher verification for your organization](/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization)". Apps with this badge cannot change their pricing plan until the publisher successfully applies for verification.
