    <p>
      Publisher verification ensures that {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has a way to contact you, that you’ve
      enabled two-factor authentication for your organization, and that your
      organization’s domain has been verified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your organization has been verified, you can publish paid plans for
      your app. For information, see “<a
        href="/developers/github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing"
        >Setting pricing plans for your listing</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To offer paid plans for your app, the app must be owned by an organization
      and you must have owner permissions in the organization. If your app is
      currently owned by a user account, you’ll need to transfer the ownership
      of the app to an organization. For more information, see “<a
        href="/developers/apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app"
        >Transferring ownership of a GitHub App</a
      >” or “<a href="/developers/apps/transferring-ownership-of-an-oauth-app"
