      You can view metrics for the past day (24 hours), week, month, or for the
      entire duration of time that your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_github_app %} has been listed.

    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Because it takes time to aggregate data, you’ll
      notice a slight delay in the dates shown. When you select a time period,
      you can see exact dates for the metrics at the top of the page.

    <h2 id="performance-metrics">Performance metrics</h2>
    <p>
      The Insights page displays these performance metrics, for the selected
      time period:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription value:</strong> Total possible revenue (in US
        dollars) for subscriptions. This value represents the possible revenue
        if no plans or free trials are cancelled and all credit transactions are
        successful. The subscription value includes the full value for plans
        that begin with a free trial in the selected time period, even when
        there are no financial transactions in that time period. The
        subscription value also includes the full value of upgraded plans in the
        selected time period but does not include the prorated amount. To see
        and download individual transactions, see “<a
          href="/marketplace/github-marketplace-transactions/"
          >GitHub Marketplace transactions</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visitors:</strong> Number of people that have viewed a page in
        your GitHub Apps listing. This number includes both logged in and logged
        out visitors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pageviews:</strong> Number of views the pages in your GitHub
        App’s listing received. A single visitor can generate more than one
        pageview.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Your estimated subscription value could be much
      higher than the transactions processed for this period.
