<p>To publish a paid plan for your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, your app must be owned by an organization that is a verified publisher. For more information about the verification process or transferring ownership of your app, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization">Applying for publisher verification for your organization</a>.”</p>
<p>If your app is already published and you’re a verified publisher, then you can publish a new paid plan from the pricing plan editor. For more information, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing">Setting pricing plans for your listing</a>.”</p>

<p>{% endnote %}</p>
<h2 id="billing-requirements-for-paid-apps">Billing requirements for paid apps</h2>
<p>Your app does not need to handle payments but does need to use {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events to manage new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials. For information about how integrate these events into your app, see “<a href="/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app">Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app</a>.”</p>
<p>Using GitHub’s billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps must support both monthly and annual billing for paid subscriptions purchases.</li>
<li>Listings may offer any combination of free and paid plans. Free plans are optional but encouraged.
