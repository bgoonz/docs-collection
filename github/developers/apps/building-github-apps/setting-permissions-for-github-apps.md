GitHub Apps don't have any permissions by default. When you create a GitHub App, you can select the permissions it needs to access end user data. Permissions can also be added and removed. For more information, see "[Editing a GitHub App's permissions](/apps/managing-github-apps/editing-a-github-app-s-permissions/)."
