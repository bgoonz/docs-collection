## About IP address allow lists for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}

Enterprise and organization owners can restrict access to assets by configuring an IP address allow list. This list specifies the IP addresses that are allowed to connect. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#enabling-allowed-ip-addresses)" and {% ifversion ghae %}"[Restricting network traffic to your enterprise](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/restricting-network-traffic-to-your-enterprise)." {% else %}"[Enforcing security settings in your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/setting-policies-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account/enforcing-security-settings-in-your-enterprise-account#managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account)." {% endif %}

When an organization has an allow list, third-party applications that connect via a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} will be denied access unless both of the following are true:

* The creator of the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} has configured an allow list for the application that specifies the IP addresses at which their application runs. See below for details of how to do this.
* The organization owner has chosen to permit the addresses in the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}'s allow list to be added to their own allow list. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#allowing-access-by-github-apps)."
