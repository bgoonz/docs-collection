      <strong>New GitHub App</strong>.

      1. In “GitHub App name”, type the name of your app.

        alt="Field for the name of your GitHub App"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Give your app a clear and succinct name. Your app cannot have the same
      name as an existing GitHub account, unless it is your own user or
      organization name. A slugged version of your app’s name will be shown in
      the user interface when your integration takes an action.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Optionally, in “Description”, type a description of your app that users
        will see.

        In “Homepage URL”, type the full URL to your app’s website.

      </li>
      <li>
        In “Callback URL”, type the full URL to redirect to after a user
        authorizes the installation. This URL is used if your app needs to
        identify and authorize user-to-server requests.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can use <strong>Add callback URL</strong> to provide additional
      callback URLs, up to a maximum of 10.

      {% else %} 1. In “User authorization callback URL”, type the full URL to
      redirect to after a user authorizes an installation. This URL is used if
      your app needs to identify and authorize user-to-server requests.

      {% endif %} {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 2.21 or ghae %} 1. By default,
      to improve your app’s security, your app will use expiring user
      authorization tokens. To opt-out of using expiring user tokens, you must
      deselect “Expire user authorization tokens”. To learn more about setting
      up a refresh token flow and the benefits of expiring user tokens, see “<a
        href="/apps/building-github-apps/refreshing-user-to-server-access-tokens/"
        >Refreshing user-to-server access tokens</a

      {% endif %} 1. If your app authorizes users using the OAuth flow, you can
      select
      <strong>Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation</strong> to
      allow people to authorize the app when they install it, saving a step. If
      you select this option, the “Setup URL” becomes unavailable and users will
      be redirected to your “User authorization callback URL” after installing
      the app. See “<a
        href="/apps/installing-github-apps/#authorizing-users-during-installation"
        >Authorizing users during installation</a
      >” for more information.

        alt="Request user authorization during installation"

      1. If additional setup is required after installation, add a “Setup URL”
      to redirect users to after they install your app.
      <img
        src="/assets/images/github-apps/github_apps_setup_url.png"
        alt="Field for the setup URL of your GitHub App"

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When you select
      <strong>Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation</strong> in
      the previous step, this field becomes unavailable and people will be
      redirected to the “User authorization callback URL” after installing the
      app.

          installed or modified, as well as any other events the app subscribes
          to.
