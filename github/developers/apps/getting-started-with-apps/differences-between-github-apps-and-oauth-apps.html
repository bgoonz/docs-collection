<p>You can install GitHub Apps in your personal account or organizations you own. If you have admin permissions in a repository, you can install GitHub Apps on organization accounts. If a GitHub App is installed in a repository and requires organization permissions, the organization owner must approve the application.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.apps.app_manager_role %}</p>
<p>By contrast, users <em>authorize</em> OAuth Apps, which gives the app the ability to act as the authenticated user. For example, you can authorize an OAuth App that finds all notifications for the authenticated user. You can always revoke permissions from an OAuth App.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-github-apps-and-oauth-apps-access">What can GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps access?</h2>
<p>Account owners can use a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} in one account without granting access to another. For example, you can install a third-party build service on your employer’s organization, but decide not to grant that build service access to repositories in your personal account. A GitHub App remains installed if the person who set it up leaves the organization.</p>
<p>An <em>authorized</em> OAuth App has access to all of the user’s or organization owner’s accessible resources.</p>

<h2 id="requesting-permission-levels-for-resources">Requesting permission levels for resources</h2>
<p>Unlike OAuth apps, GitHub Apps have targeted permissions that allow them to request access only to what they need. For example, a Continuous Integration (CI) GitHub App can request read access to repository content and write access to the status API. Another GitHub App can have no read or write access to code but still have the ability to manage issues, labels, and milestones. OAuth Apps can’t use granular permissions.</p>
