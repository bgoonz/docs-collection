{% note %}

**Note:** Updated permissions won't take effect on an installation until the owner of the account or organization approves the changes. You can use the [InstallationEvent webhook](/webhooks/event-payloads/#installation) to find out when people accept new permissions for your app. One exception is [user-level permissions](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/#user-level-permissions), which don't require the account owner to approve permission changes.
