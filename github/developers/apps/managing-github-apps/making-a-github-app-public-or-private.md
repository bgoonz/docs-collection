For authentication information, see "[Authenticating with GitHub Apps](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation)."

## Public installation flow

Public installation flows have a landing page to enable other people besides the app owner to install the app in their repositories. This link is provided in the "Public link" field when setting up your GitHub App. For more information, see "[Installing GitHub Apps](/apps/installing-github-apps/)."

## Private installation flow

Private installation flows allow only the owner of a GitHub App to install it. Limited information about the GitHub App will still exist on a public page, but the **Install** button will only be available to organization administrators or the user account if the GitHub App is owned by an individual account. Private{% ifversion ghes < 3.2 or ghae %}, or internal,{% endif %} GitHub Apps can only be installed on the user or organization account of the owner.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
