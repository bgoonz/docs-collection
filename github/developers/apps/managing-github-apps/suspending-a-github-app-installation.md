## Suspending a GitHub App

The integrator who owns and maintains a GitHub app, also called a GitHub App owner, can suspend or unsuspend a GitHub App installation using REST API endpoints with a JWT. For more information, see the [GitHub Apps REST API](/rest/reference/apps).

People who have installed a GitHub App, also called installation owners, can only suspend or unsuspend a GitHub App through their app's installation settings. Installation owners cannot use the API to suspend or unsuspend their app installation.
