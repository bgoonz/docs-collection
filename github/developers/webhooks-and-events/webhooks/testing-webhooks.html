<p>Now that you’ve <a href="/webhooks/configuring/">configured your local server</a>, you might be interested in pushing your code to the limits. To that end, GitHub’s webhooks view provides some tooling for testing your deployed payloads.</p>
<h2 id="listing-recent-deliveries">Listing recent deliveries</h2>
<p>Every webhook has its own “Recent Deliveries” section, which lists, at a glance whether a delivery was successful (green check) or failed (red x). You can also identify when each delivery was attempted.</p>
<p>{% data variables.product.product_name %} keeps a log of each webhook delivery for {% ifversion fpt %} 30 {% else %} 8 {% endif %} days.</p>

<h2 id="digging-into-results">Digging into results</h2>
<p>By expanding an individual delivery, you’ll be able to witness <em>precisely</em> what information GitHub is attempting to send to your server. This includes both the HTTP Request and Response.</p>
<h3 id="request">Request</h3>
<p>The webhook delivery view provides information on which Headers were sent by GitHub. It also includes details about the JSON payload.</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<p>The response tab lists how your server replied once it received the payload from GitHub. This includes the status code, the headers, and any additional data within the response body.</p>
