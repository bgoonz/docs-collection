      You can deliver deployments through {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 %}{%
      data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and environments or with {%
      endif %}the REST API and third party apps. {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt;
      3.0 %}For more information about {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see “<a href="/actions"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}</a
      >.” {% endif %}For more information about deployments with the REST API,
      see “<a href="/rest/reference/repos#deployments">Repositories</a>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To view current and past deployments, click
      <strong>Environments</strong> on the home page of your repository. {%
      ifversion ghae or ghes &lt; 3.0 %}
      <img
        src="/assets/images/enterprise/2.22/environments-sidebar.png"
        alt="Environments"
      />{% else %}
      <img src="/assets/images/environments-sidebar.png" alt="Environments" />{%
      endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      The deployments page displays the last active deployment of each
      environment for your repository. If the deployment includes an environment
      URL, a “View deployment” button that links to the URL is shown next to the
      deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The activity log shows the deployment history for your environments. By
      default, only the most recent deployment for an environment has an
      <code>Active</code> status; all previously active deployments have an
      <code>Inactive</code> status. For more information on automatic
      inactivation of deployments, see “<a
        href="/rest/reference/repos#inactive-deployments"
        >Inactive deployments</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the REST API to get information about deployments. For
      more information, see “<a href="/rest/reference/repos#deployments"
        >Repositories</a
      >.”
