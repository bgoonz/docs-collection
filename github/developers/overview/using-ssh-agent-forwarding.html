    <p>
      SSH agent forwarding can be used to make deploying to a server simple. It
      allows you to use your local SSH keys instead of leaving keys (without
      passphrases!) sitting on your server.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve already set up an SSH key to interact with {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}, you’re probably familiar with
      <code>ssh-agent</code>. It’s a program that runs in the background and
      keeps your key loaded into memory, so that you don’t need to enter your
      passphrase every time you need to use the key. The nifty thing is, you can
      choose to let servers access your local <code>ssh-agent</code> as if they
      were already running on the server. This is sort of like asking a friend
      to enter their password so that you can use their computer.

      Setting up SSH agent forwarding

    <p>
      Ensure that your own SSH key is set up and working. You can use
      <a href="/articles/generating-ssh-keys"
        >our guide on generating SSH keys</a
      >
      if you’ve not done this yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can test that your local key works by entering
      <code
        >ssh -T git@{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}hostname{% else %}github.com{%
        endif %}</code
      >
      in the terminal:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ ssh -T git@{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}hostname{% else %}github.com{% endif %}
# Attempt to SSH in to github
&gt; Hi &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;! You&#39;ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide
&gt; shell access.</code></pre>
    <p>
      We’re off to a great start. Let’s set up SSH to allow agent forwarding to
      your server.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Using your favorite text editor, open up the file at
          <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. If this file doesn’t exist, you can create
          it by entering <code>touch ~/.ssh/config</code> in the terminal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Enter the following text into the file, replacing
          <code>example.com</code> with your server’s domain name or IP:
        </p>
        <pre><code> Host example.com
   ForwardAgent yes</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> You may be tempted to use a wildcard like
      <code>Host *</code> to just apply this setting to all SSH connections.
      That’s not really a good idea, as you’d be sharing your local SSH keys
      with <em>every</em> server you SSH into. They won’t have direct access to
      the keys, but they will be able to use them <em>as you</em> while the
      connection is established.
      <strong
        >You should only add servers you trust and that you intend to use with
        agent forwarding.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <h2 id="testing-ssh-agent-forwarding">Testing SSH agent forwarding</h2>
    <p>
      To test that agent forwarding is working with your server, you can SSH
      into your server and run
      <code
        >ssh -T git@{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}hostname{% else %}github.com{%
        endif %}</code
      >
      once more. If all is well, you’ll get back the same prompt as you did
      locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re unsure if your local key is being used, you can also inspect the
      <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable on your server:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ echo &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot;
# Print out the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable
&gt; /tmp/ssh-4hNGMk8AZX/agent.79453</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the variable is not set, it means that agent forwarding is not working:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ echo &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot;
# Print out the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable
&gt; &lt;em&gt;[No output]&lt;/em&gt;
$ ssh -T git@{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}hostname{% else %}github.com{% endif %}
# Try to SSH to github
&gt; Permission denied (publickey).</code></pre>

      Troubleshooting SSH agent forwarding

    <p>
      Here are some things to look out for when troubleshooting SSH agent
      forwarding.
    </p>
    <h3 id="you-must-be-using-an-ssh-url-to-check-out-code">
      You must be using an SSH URL to check out code
    </h3>
    <p>
      SSH forwarding only works with SSH URLs, not HTTP(s) URLs. Check the
      <em>.git/config</em> file on your server and ensure the URL is an
      SSH-style URL like below:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
  url = git@{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}hostname{% else %}github.com{% endif %}:&lt;em&gt;yourAccount&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;yourProject&lt;/em&gt;.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code></pre>
    <h3 id="your-ssh-keys-must-work-locally">
      Your SSH keys must work locally
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before you can make your keys work through agent forwarding, they must
      work locally first.
      <a href="/articles/generating-ssh-keys"
        >Our guide on generating SSH keys</a
      >
      can help you set up your SSH keys locally.
    </p>
    <h3 id="your-system-must-allow-ssh-agent-forwarding">
      Your system must allow SSH agent forwarding
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, system configurations disallow SSH agent forwarding. You can
      check if a system configuration file is being used by entering the
      following command in the terminal:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ ssh -v &lt;em&gt;example.com&lt;/em&gt;
# Connect to example.com with verbose debug output
&gt; OpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3&lt;/span&gt;
&gt; debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;/.ssh/config
&gt; debug1: Applying options for example.com
&gt; debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config
&gt; debug1: Applying options for *
$ exit
# Returns to your local command prompt</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the example above, the file <em>~/.ssh/config</em> is loaded first,
      then <em>/etc/ssh_config</em> is read. We can inspect that file to see if
      it’s overriding our options by running the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ cat /etc/ssh_config
# Print out the /etc/ssh_config file
&gt; Host *
&gt;   SendEnv LANG LC_*
&gt;   ForwardAgent no</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, our <em>/etc/ssh_config</em> file specifically says
      <code>ForwardAgent no</code>, which is a way to block agent forwarding.
      Deleting this line from the file should get agent forwarding working once
      more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="your-server-must-allow-ssh-agent-forwarding-on-inbound-connections">
      Your server must allow SSH agent forwarding on inbound connections
    </h3>
    <p>
      Agent forwarding may also be blocked on your server. You can check that
      agent forwarding is permitted by SSHing into the server and running
      <code>sshd_config</code>. The output from this command should indicate
      that <code>AllowAgentForwarding</code> is set.
    </p>
    <h3 id="your-local-ssh-agent-must-be-running">
      Your local <code>ssh-agent</code> must be running
    </h3>
    <p>
      On most computers, the operating system automatically launches
      <code>ssh-agent</code> for you. On Windows, however, you need to do this
      manually. We have
      <a
        href="/github/authenticating-to-github/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#auto-launching-ssh-agent-on-git-for-windows"
        >a guide on how to start <code>ssh-agent</code> whenever you open Git
        Bash</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To verify that <code>ssh-agent</code> is running on your computer, type
      the following command in the terminal:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ echo &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot;
# Print out the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable
&gt; /tmp/launch-kNSlgU/Listeners</code></pre>
    <h3 id="your-key-must-be-available-to-ssh-agent">
      Your key must be available to <code>ssh-agent</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can check that your key is visible to <code>ssh-agent</code> by
      running the following command:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>ssh-add -L</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the command says that no identity is available, you’ll need to add your
      key:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ ssh-add &lt;em&gt;yourkey&lt;/em&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>{% tip %}</p>
    <p>
      On macOS, <code>ssh-agent</code> will “forget” this key, once it gets
      restarted during reboots. But you can import your SSH keys into Keychain
      using this command:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ ssh-add -K &lt;em&gt;yourkey&lt;/em&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>{% endtip %}</p>
