## About sponsorship updates

Your sponsors can choose whether they receive email updates about your work. For more information, see "[Managing your sponsorship](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/managing-your-sponsorship)."

For sponsored developer accounts, the update will come from your user account's primary email address. If you've enabled email address privacy on your user account, the update will come from `noreply@github.com` instead. For sponsored organizations, the update will come from the organization's `noreply@github.com` email address. For more information, see "[Setting your commit email address](/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address)."
