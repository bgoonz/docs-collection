If you are a taxpayer in the United States, you must submit a W-9 before you can receive payments. If you are a taxpayer in any other region besides the United States, you must submit a W-8BEN before you can receive payments. For more information, see "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your user account](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-user-account#submitting-your-tax-information)" and "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your organization](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization#submitting-your-tax-information)." {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send you the appropriate forms, notify you when they are due, and give you a reasonable amount of time to complete and send in the forms.

If you are a taxpayer in the United States and earn more than $600 USD in a tax year, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send you a 1099 before January 31 of the next calendar year. We do not provide tax forms for international taxpayers.

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} does not withhold tax from {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} payments. Sponsored developers are responsible for evaluating and paying their own taxes.
