## About sponsors and sponsorships

You can view analytics on your current and past sponsorships, the payments you've received from sponsors, and events, such as cancellations and sponsor tier changes for your sponsorships. You can also view activity such as new sponsorships, changes to sponsorships, and canceled sponsorships. You can filter the list of activities by date. You can also export sponsorship data for the account you're viewing in CSV or JSON format.
