## About webhooks for events in your sponsored account

To monitor changes to your sponsorships, such as cancellations at the end of a pay period, you can create webhooks for your sponsored user or organization account. When you set up a webhook for your sponsored account, you'll receive updates when sponsorships are created, edited, or deleted. For more information, see the [`sponsorship` webhook event](/webhooks/event-payloads/#sponsorship).
