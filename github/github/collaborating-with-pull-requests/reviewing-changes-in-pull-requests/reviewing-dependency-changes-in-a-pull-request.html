      Dependency review allows you to “shift left”. You can use the provided
      predictive information to catch vulnerable dependencies before they hit
      production. For more information, see “<a

        >About dependency review</a

          <strong>File filter</strong> drop-down menu to collapse all files that
          don’t record dependencies. This will make it easier to focus your
          review on the dependency changes.

          Any added or changed dependencies that have vulnerabilities are listed
          first, ordered by severity and then by dependency name. This means
          that the highest severity dependencies are always at the top of a
          dependency review. Other dependencies are listed alphabetically by
          dependency name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The icon beside each dependency indicates whether the dependency has
          been added (<span style="color: #22863a"
            >{% octicon “diff-added” aria-label=“Dependency added icon” %}</span
          >), updated (<span style="color: #b08800"
            >{% octicon “diff-modified” aria-label=“Dependency modified icon”
            %}</span
          >), or removed (<span style="color: #cb2431"
            >{% octicon “diff-removed” aria-label=“Dependency removed icon”
            %}</span
          >) in this pull request.

        <p>Other information includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The version, or version range, of the new, updated, or deleted
            dependency.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a specific version of a dependency:
            <ul>
              <li>The age of that release of the dependency.</li>
              <li>
                The number of projects that are dependent on this software. This
                information is taken from the dependency graph. Checking the
                number of dependents can help you avoid accidentally adding the
                wrong dependency.
              </li>
              <li>
                The license used by this dependency, if this information is
                available. This is useful if you want to avoid code with certain
                licenses being used in your project.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where a dependency has a known vulnerability, the warning message
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A brief description of the vulnerability.</li>
          <li>
            A Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or {% data
            variables.product.prodname_security_advisories %} (GHSA)
            identification number. You can click this ID to find out more about
            the vulnerability.
          </li>
          <li>The severity of the vulnerability.</li>
          <li>
            The version of the dependency in which the vulnerability was fixed.
            If you are reviewing a pull request for someone, you might ask the
            contributor to update the dependency to the patched version, or a
            later release.
