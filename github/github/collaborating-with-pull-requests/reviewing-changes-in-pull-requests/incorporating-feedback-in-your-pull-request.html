<h2 id="applying-suggested-changes">Applying suggested changes</h2>
<p>Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository. If the pull request was created from a fork and the author allowed edits from maintainers, you can also apply suggested changes if you have write access to the upstream repository. For more information, see “<a href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request">Commenting on a pull request</a>” and “<a href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork">Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork</a>.”</p>
<p>To quickly incorporate more than one suggested change into a single commit, you can also apply suggested changes as a batch. Applying one suggested change or a batch of suggested changes creates a single commit on the compare branch of the pull request.</p>
<p>Each person who suggested a change included in the commit will be a co-author of the commit. The person who applies the suggested changes will be a co-author and the committer of the commit. For more information about the term committer in Git, see “<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History">Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History</a>” from the <em>Pro Git</em> book site.</p>
