## Applying suggested changes

Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository. If the pull request was created from a fork and the author allowed edits from maintainers, you can also apply suggested changes if you have write access to the upstream repository. For more information, see "[Commenting on a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)" and "[Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)."

To quickly incorporate more than one suggested change into a single commit, you can also apply suggested changes as a batch. Applying one suggested change or a batch of suggested changes creates a single commit on the compare branch of the pull request.

Each person who suggested a change included in the commit will be a co-author of the commit. The person who applies the suggested changes will be a co-author and the committer of the commit. For more information about the term committer in Git, see "[Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)" from the _Pro Git_ book site.

## Opening an issue for an out-of-scope suggestion

If someone suggests changes to your pull request and the changes are out of the pull request's scope, you can open a new issue to track the feedback. For more information, see "[Opening an issue from a comment](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-a-comment)."
