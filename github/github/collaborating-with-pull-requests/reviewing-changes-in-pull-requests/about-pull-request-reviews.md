## About pull request reviews

After a pull request is opened, anyone with *read* access can review and comment on the changes it proposes. You can also suggest specific changes to lines of code, which the author can apply directly from the pull request. For more information, see "[Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](/articles/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)."

Repository owners and collaborators can request a pull request review from a specific person. Organization members can also request a pull request review from a team with read access to the repository. For more information, see "[Requesting a pull request review](/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review)." {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}You can specify a subset of team members to be automatically assigned in the place of the whole team. For more information, see "[Managing code review assignment for your team](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team)."{% endif %}

Reviews allow for discussion of proposed changes and help ensure that the changes meet the repository's contributing guidelines and other quality standards. You can define which individuals or teams own certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file. When a pull request modifies code that has a defined owner, that individual or team will automatically be requested as a reviewer. For more information, see "[About code owners](/articles/about-code-owners/)."

{% ifversion fpt %}You can schedule reminders for pull requests that need to be reviewed. For more information, see "[Managing scheduled reminders for pull requests](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-pull-requests)."{% endif %}

A review has three possible statuses:
- **Comment**: Submit general feedback without explicitly approving the changes or requesting additional changes.
- **Approve**: Submit feedback and approve merging the changes proposed in the pull request.
- **Request changes**: Submit feedback that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.
