Anyone with read access to a repository can see a summary list of the functions and methods changes in certain files of a pull request.

The summary list of methods and functions is created from these supported file types:
  - Go
  - JavaScript (includes Typescript, Flow, and other types of JavaScript)
  - PHP
  - Python
  - Ruby

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %}
2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request where you'd like to find the changed functions and methods.
{% data reusables.repositories.changed-files %}
4. To see a summary list of the changed functions and methods, click **Jump to...**.

5. Select the changed function or method from the drop-down menu. You can also enter the name of the function or method to filter results.

 {% note %}

 **Note:** If you don't see the functions or methods you expected, confirm that your code compiles and doesn't contain errors. Only functions and methods changed in this pull request and found in *.go*, *.js*, *.ts*, *.py*, *.php*, and *.rb* files appear in the drop-down menu.

 {% endnote %}

6. You'll be redirected to the first line of the function or method you selected.
