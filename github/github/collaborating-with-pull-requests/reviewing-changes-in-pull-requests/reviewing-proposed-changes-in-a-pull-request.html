    <p>
      You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While
      reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments
      on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark
      the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the
      files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header
      shows the number of files you’ve viewed. After reviewing as many files as
      you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes
      by submitting your review with a summary comment.

      submit your review. To cancel a pending review, including all of its
      pending comments, scroll down to the end of the timeline on the
      Conversation tab, then click <strong>Cancel review</strong>.

      If the pull request contains changes to dependencies you can use the
      dependency review for a manifest or lock file to see what has changed and
      check whether the changes introduce security vulnerabilities. For more
      information, see “<a
