    <p>
      Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major
      differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork
        to the original repository, also known as the
        <em>upstream</em> repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by
        synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>{% data reusables.repositories.desktop-fork %}</p>
    <p>
      Deleting a fork will not delete the original upstream repository. You can
      make any changes you want to your fork—add collaborators, rename files,
      generate {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}—with no effect on the
      original.{% ifversion fpt %} You cannot restore a deleted forked
      repository. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/restoring-a-deleted-repository"
        >Restoring a deleted repository</a
      >.”{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or
      changes before they are offered back to the upstream repository. When you
      make changes in your user-owned fork and open a pull request that compares
      your work to the upstream repository, you can give anyone with push access
      to the upstream repository permission to push changes to your pull request
      branch. This speeds up collaboration by allowing repository maintainers
      the ability to make commits or run tests locally to your pull request
      branch from a user-owned fork before merging. You cannot give push
      permissions to a fork owned by an organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to create a new repository from the contents of an existing
      repository but don’t want to merge your changes upstream in the future,
      you can duplicate the repository or, if the repository is a template, use
      the repository as a template. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/duplicating-a-repository"
        >Duplicating a repository</a
      >” and “<a href="/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template"
        >Creating a repository from a template</a
