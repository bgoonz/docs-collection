Only pull request authors can give upstream repository maintainers, or those with push access to the upstream repository, permission to make commits to their pull request's compare branch in a user-owned fork. To learn more about upstream repositories, see "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."

Pull request authors can give these permissions when they initially create a pull request from a user-owned fork or after they create the pull request. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)."

You can set commit permissions when you first create a pull request from a fork. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)." Additionally, you can modify an existing pull request to let repository maintainers make commits to your branch.

## Enabling repository maintainer permissions on existing pull requests

1. On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, navigate to the main page of the upstream repository of your pull request.
2. Under the upstream repository name, click {% octicon "git-pull-request" aria-label="The pull request icon" %} **Pull requests**.

3. In the list of pull requests, navigate to the pull request that you'd like to allow commits on.
{% data reusables.repositories.allow-maintainers-user-forks %}
