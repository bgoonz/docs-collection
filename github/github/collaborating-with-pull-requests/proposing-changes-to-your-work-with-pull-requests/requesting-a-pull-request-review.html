      Owners and collaborators on a repository owned by a user account can
      assign pull request reviews. Organization members with triage permissions
      to a repository can assign a pull request review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owners or collaborators can assign a pull request review to any person
      that has been explicitly granted
      <a href="/articles/access-permissions-on-github">read access</a> to a
      user-owned repository. Organization members can assign a pull request
      review to any person or team with read access to a repository. The
      requested reviewer or team will receive a notification that you asked them
      to review the pull request. {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}If you
      request a review from a team and code review assignment is enabled,
      specific members will be requested and the team will be removed as a
      reviewer. For more information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team"
        >Managing code review assignment for your team</a
      >.”{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Pull request authors can’t request reviews unless
      they are either a repository owner or collaborator with write access to
      the repository.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      You can request a review from either a suggested or specific person.
      Suggested reviewers are based on
      <a href="/articles/tracking-changes-in-a-file/">git blame data</a>. If you
      request a review, other people with read access to the repository can
      still review your pull request. Once someone has reviewed your pull
      request and you’ve made the necessary changes, you can re-request review
      from the same reviewer. If the requested reviewer does not submit a
      review, and the pull request meets the repository’s
      <a href="/articles/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests"
        >mergeability requirements</a
      >, you can still merge the pull request.
