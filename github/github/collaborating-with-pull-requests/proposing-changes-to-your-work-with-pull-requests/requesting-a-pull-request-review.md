Owners and collaborators on a repository owned by a user account can assign pull request reviews. Organization members with triage permissions to a repository can assign a pull request review.

Owners or collaborators can assign a pull request review to any person that has been explicitly granted [read access](/articles/access-permissions-on-github) to a user-owned repository. Organization members can assign a pull request review to any person or team with read access to a repository. The requested reviewer or team will receive a notification that you asked them to review the pull request. {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}If you request a review from a team and code review assignment is enabled, specific members will be requested and the team will be removed as a reviewer. For more information, see "[Managing code review assignment for your team](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team)."{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note:** Pull request authors can't request reviews unless they are either a repository owner or collaborator with write access to the repository.

{% endnote %}

You can request a review from either a suggested or specific person. Suggested reviewers are based on [git blame data](/articles/tracking-changes-in-a-file/). If you request a review, other people with read access to the repository can still review your pull request. Once someone has reviewed your pull request and you've made the necessary changes, you can re-request review from the same reviewer. If the requested reviewer does not submit a review, and the pull request meets the repository's [mergeability requirements](/articles/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests), you can still merge the pull request.
