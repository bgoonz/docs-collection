        Committing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork

    </header>
    <p>
      You can only make commits on pull request branches that: - are opened in a
      repository that you have push access to and that were created from a fork
      of that repository - are on a user-owned fork - have permission granted
      from the pull request creator - don’t have
      <a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches"
        >branch restrictions</a
      >
      that will prevent you from committing
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the user who created the pull request can give you permission to push
      commits to the user-owned fork. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork"
        >Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can also make commits to a pull request branch
      from a fork of your repository through {% data
      variables.product.product_location %} by creating your own copy (or fork)
      of the fork of your repository and committing changes to the same head
      branch that the original pull request changes were created on. For some
      general guidelines, see “<a
        href="/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork"
        >Creating a pull request from a fork</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, navigate to the main page
        of the fork (or copy of your repository) where the pull request branch
        was created. {% data reusables.repositories.copy-clone-url %} {% data
        reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %} {% tip %}
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you prefer to clone the fork using {% data
      variables.product.prodname_desktop %}, then see “<a
        href="/articles/cloning-a-repository/#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop"
        >Cloning a repository to {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop
        %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {% endtip %} 4. Change the current working directory to the location where
      you want to download the cloned directory.
      <code>shell $ cd open-source-projects</code> 5. Type
      <code>git clone</code>, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
      <code
        >shell $ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock
        %}/&lt;em&gt;USERNAME&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY&lt;/em&gt;</code
      >
      6. Press <strong>Enter</strong>. Your local clone will be created.
      <code
        >shell $ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock
        %}/&lt;em&gt;USERNAME&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY&lt;/em&gt;
        &gt; Cloning into `FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY`... &gt; remote: Counting
        objects: 10, done. &gt; remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
        &gt; remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1) &gt; Unpacking
        objects: 100% (10/10), done.</code
      >
      {% tip %}
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> The error message “fatal: destination path
      ‘REPOSITORY-NAME’ already exists and is not an empty directory” means that
      your current working directory already contains a repository with the same
      name. To resolve the error, you must clone the fork in a different
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% endtip %} 7. Navigate into your new cloned repository.
      <code>shell $ cd &lt;em&gt;FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY&lt;/em&gt;</code> 7.
      Switch branches to the compare branch of the pull request where the
      original changes were made. If you navigate to the original pull request,
      you’ll see the compare branch at the top of the pull request.
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/pull_requests/compare-branch-example.png"
        alt="compare-branch-example"
      />
      In this example, the compare branch is <code>test-branch</code>:
      <code>shell $ git checkout &lt;em&gt;test-branch&lt;/em&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <p>{% tip %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> For more information about pull request branches,
      including examples, see “<a
        href="/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository"
        >Creating a Pull Request</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {% endtip %} 8. At this point, you can do anything you want with this
      branch. You can push new commits to it, run some local tests, or merge
      other branches into the branch. Make modifications as you like. 9. After
      you commit your changes to the head branch of the pull request you can
      push your changes up to the original pull request directly. In this
      example, the head branch is <code>test-branch</code>:
      <code
        >shell $ git push origin &lt;em&gt;test-branch&lt;/em&gt; &gt; Counting
        objects: 32, done. &gt; Delta compression using up to 8 threads. &gt;
        Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done. &gt; Writing objects: 100%
        (29/29), 74.94 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. &gt; Total 29 (delta 8), reused 0
        (delta 0) &gt; To https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock
        %}/&lt;em&gt;USERNAME&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY&lt;/em&gt;.git
        &gt; 12da2e9..250e946 &lt;em&gt;test-branch&lt;/em&gt; -&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;test-branch&lt;/em&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Your new commits will be reflected on the original pull request on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}.
