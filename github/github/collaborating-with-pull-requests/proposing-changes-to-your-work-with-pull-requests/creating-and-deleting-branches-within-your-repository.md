## Deleting a branch

{% data reusables.pull_requests.automatically-delete-branches %}

{% note %}

**Note:** If the branch you want to delete is the repository's default branch, you must choose a new default branch before deleting the branch. For more information, see "[Changing the default branch](/github/administering-a-repository/changing-the-default-branch)."

{% endnote %}

If the branch you want to delete is associated with an open pull request, you must merge or close the pull request before deleting the branch. For more information, see "[Merging a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request)" or "[Closing a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/closing-a-pull-request)."

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-branches %}
1. Scroll to the branch that you want to delete, then click {% octicon "trash" aria-label="The trash icon to delete the branch" %}.
