      When you squash and merge, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}
      generates a commit message which you can change if you want to. The
      message default depends on whether the pull request contains multiple
      commits or just one. We do not include merge commits when we count the
      total number of commits.

      Squashing and merging a long-running branch
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you plan to continue work on the
      <a href="/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#head-branch"
        >head branch</a
      >
      of a pull request after the pull request is merged, we recommend you don’t
      squash and merge the pull request.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create a pull request, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %} identifies the most recent commit that is on both the head branch and
      the
      <a href="/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#base-branch"
        >base branch</a
      >: the common ancestor commit. When you squash and merge the pull request,
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} creates a commit on the base
      branch that contains all of the changes you made on the head branch since
      the common ancestor commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this commit is only on the base branch and not the head branch,
      the common ancestor of the two branches remains unchanged. If you continue
      to work on the head branch, then create a new pull request between the two
      branches, the pull request will include all of the commits since the
      common ancestor, including commits that you squashed and merged in the
      previous pull request. If there are no conflicts, you can safely merge
      these commits. However, this workflow makes merge conflicts more likely.
      If you continue to squash and merge pull requests for a long-running head
      branch, you will have to resolve the same conflicts repeatedly.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits">
      Rebase and merge your pull request commits
    </h2>
    <p>{% data reusables.pull_requests.rebase_and_merge_summary %}</p>
    <p>
      You aren’t able to automatically rebase and merge on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %} when: - The pull request has merge
      conflicts. - Rebasing the commits from the base branch into the head
      branch runs into conflicts. - Rebasing the commits is considered “unsafe,”
      such as when a rebase is possible without merge conflicts but would
      produce a different result than a merge would.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you still want to rebase the commits but can’t rebase and merge
      automatically on {% data variables.product.product_location %} you must: -
      Rebase the topic branch (or head branch) onto the base branch locally on
      the command line -
      <a href="/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/"
        >Resolve any merge conflicts on the command line</a
      >. - Force-push the rebased commits to the pull request’s topic branch (or
      remote head branch).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone with write permissions in the repository, can then
      <a href="/articles/merging-a-pull-request/">merge the changes</a> using
      the rebase and merge button on {% data variables.product.product_location
      %}.
