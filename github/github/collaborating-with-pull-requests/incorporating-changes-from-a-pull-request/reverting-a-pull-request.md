## About reverting a pull request

Reverting a pull request on {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates a new pull request that contains one revert of the merge commit from the original merged pull request.

## Reverting a pull request

{% note %}

**Note:** You may need to revert the individual commits in your pull request if either of the following is true.

- Reverting the pull request causes merge conflicts
- The original pull request was not originally merged on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For example, someone could have merged the pull request using a fast-forward merge on the command line.

For more information about using Git to manually revert individual commits, see [Git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html) in the Git documentation.
