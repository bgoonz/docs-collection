## About scheduled reminders for users

Scheduled reminders are used to make sure that users focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to you in Slack with open pull requests needing your review at a specified time. For example, you can setup scheduled reminders to send you a message in Slack every morning at 10 AM with pull requests needing to be reviewed by you or one of your teams.

For certain events, you can also enable real-time alerts for scheduled reminders. Real-time alerts get sent to your Slack channel as soon as an important event, such as when you are assigned a review, takes place.

You can set scheduled reminders for personal or team-level review requests for pull requests in organizations you are a member of. Before you can create a scheduled reminder for yourself, an organization owner must authorize your Slack workspace. For more information, see "[Managing scheduled reminders for your organization](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-organization)."
