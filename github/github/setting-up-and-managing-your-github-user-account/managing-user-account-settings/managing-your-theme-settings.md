For choice and flexibility in how and when you use {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can configure theme settings to change how {% data variables.product.product_name %} looks to you. You can choose from themes that are light or dark, or you can configure {% data variables.product.product_name %} to follow your system settings.

You may want to use a dark theme to reduce power consumption on certain devices, to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions, or because you prefer how the theme looks.{% ifversion fpt or ghae-issue-4618 %} People with visual impairment may benefit from the dark high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements.{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}{% note %}

**Note:** The dark high contrast theme is currently available as a public beta. You can enable the dark high contrast theme using feature preview. For more information, see "[Exploring beta releases with feature preview](/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview#exploring-beta-releases-with-feature-preview)."
