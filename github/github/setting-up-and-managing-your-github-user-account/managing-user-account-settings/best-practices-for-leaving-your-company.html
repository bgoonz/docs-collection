      Before you leave your company, make sure you update the following
      information in your user account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unverify your company email address by
        <a href="/articles/changing-your-primary-email-address"
          >deleting it in your Email settings</a
        >. You can then re-add it without verifying to keep any associated
        commits linked to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/articles/changing-your-primary-email-address"
          >Change your primary email address</a
        >
        from your company email to your personal email. {% ifversion fpt %}
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/articles/verifying-your-email-address"
          >Verify your new primary email address</a
        >. {% endif %}
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/articles/changing-your-github-username"
          >Change your GitHub username</a
        >
        to remove any references to your company or organization, if necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="leaving-organizations">Leaving organizations</h2>
    <p>
      If you’ve been working with repositories that belong to an organization,
      you’ll want to
      <a href="/articles/removing-yourself-from-an-organization"
        >remove yourself as a member of the organization</a
      >. Note that if you are the organization owner, you should first
      <a href="/articles/transferring-organization-ownership"
        >transfer ownership of the organization</a
      >
      to another person.
    </p>
    <h2 id="removing-professional-associations-with-personal-repositories">
      Removing professional associations with personal repositories
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’ve been collaborating professionally with another person on
      repositories that belong to their personal user account, you’ll want to
      <a href="/articles/removing-yourself-from-a-collaborator-s-repository"
        >remove yourself as a collaborator</a
      >
      from those repositories.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/watching">Stop watching repositories</a>
        related to your work. You won’t want those notifications anymore!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/articles/how-to-transfer-a-repository"
          >Transfer repositories you own</a
        >
        that others may need to continue working on after you leave.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/articles/deleting-a-repository"
          >Delete forks that belong to you</a
        >
        that are related to the work you were doing. Don’t worry, deleting a
        fork doesn’t delete the upstream repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        Delete local copies of your forks that may exist on your computer:
      </li>
    </ul>
