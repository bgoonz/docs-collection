A collaborator is a person who has permissions to a project board you own. A collaborator's permissions will default to read access. For more information, see "[Permission levels for user-owned project boards](/articles/permission-levels-for-user-owned-project-boards)."

## Inviting collaborators to a user-owned project board

1. Navigate to the project board where you want to add an collaborator.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
{% data reusables.project-management.access-collaboration-settings %}
{% data reusables.project-management.collaborator-option %}
5. Under "Search by username, full name or email address", type the collaborator's name, username, or {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} email.

{% data reusables.project-management.add-collaborator %}
7. The new collaborator has read permissions by default. Optionally, next to the new collaborator's name, use the drop-down menu and choose a different permission level.
