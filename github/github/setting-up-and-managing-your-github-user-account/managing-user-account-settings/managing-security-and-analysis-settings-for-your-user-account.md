## About management of security and analysis settings

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can help secure your repositories. This topic tells you how you can manage the security and analysis features for all your existing or new repositories.

You can still manage the security and analysis features for individual repositories. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

{% data reusables.security.some-security-and-analysis-features-are-enabled-by-default %}

For an overview of repository-level security, see "[Securing your repository](/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository)."
