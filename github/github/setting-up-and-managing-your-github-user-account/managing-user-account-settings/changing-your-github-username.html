    <p>
      You can change your username to another username that is not currently in
      use.{% ifversion fpt %} If the username you want is not available, you’ll
      see information about whether you can request the username to be released
      when you type in the desired username.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the username is not eligible for release and you don’t hold a trademark
      for the username, you can choose another username or keep your current
      username. {% data variables.contact.github_support %} cannot release the
      unavailable username for you. For more information, see “<a
        href="#changing-your-username"
        >Changing your username</a
      >.”{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      After changing your username, your old username becomes available for
      anyone else to claim. Most references to your repositories under the old
      username automatically change to the new username. However, some links to
      your profile won’t automatically redirect.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} cannot set up redirects for: -
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentions">[@mentions]</span
      >(/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams)
      using your old username - Links to
      <a href="/articles/creating-gists">gists</a> that include your old
      username
    </p>
    <h2 id="repository-references">Repository references</h2>
    <p>
      After you change your username, {% data variables.product.product_name %}
      will automatically redirect references to your repositories. - Web links
      to your existing repositories will continue to work. This can take a few
      minutes to complete after you make the change. - Command line pushes from
      your local repository clones to the old remote tracking URLs will continue
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same
      name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your
      redirect will stop working. Because of this possibility, we recommend you
      update all existing remote repository URLs after changing your username.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/getting-started-with-github/managing-remote-repositories"
        >Managing remote repositories</a

      <code
        >https://{% data variables.command_line.backticks
        %}/previoususername</code
      >, will return a 404 error. We recommend updating any links to your {%
      data variables.product.product_name %} account from elsewhere{% ifversion
      fpt %}, such as your LinkedIn or Twitter profile{% endif %}.
