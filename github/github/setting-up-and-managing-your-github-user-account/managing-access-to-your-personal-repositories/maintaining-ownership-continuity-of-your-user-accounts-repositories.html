<h2 id="about-successors">About successors</h2>
<p>We recommend inviting another {% data variables.product.company_short %} user to be your successor, to manage your user owned repositories if you cannot. As a successor, they will have permission to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archive your public repositories.</li>
<li>Transfer your public repositories to their own user owned account.</li>
<li>Transfer your public repositories to an organization where they can create repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successors cannot log into your account.</p>
<p>An appointed successor can manage your public repositories after presenting a death certificate then waiting for 7 days or presenting an obituary then waiting for 21 days. For more information, see “<a href="/github/site-policy/github-deceased-user-policy">{% data variables.product.company_short %} Deceased User Policy</a>.”</p>
<p>To request access to manage repositories as a successor, contact <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inviting-a-successor">Inviting a successor</h2>
<p>The person you invite to be your successor must have a {% data variables.product.company_short %} account.</p>
