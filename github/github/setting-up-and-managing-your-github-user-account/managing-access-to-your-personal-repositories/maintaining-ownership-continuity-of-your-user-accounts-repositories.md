## About successors

We recommend inviting another {% data variables.product.company_short %} user to be your successor, to manage your user owned repositories if you cannot. As a successor, they will have permission to:

- Archive your public repositories.
- Transfer your public repositories to their own user owned account.
- Transfer your public repositories to an organization where they can create repositories.

Successors cannot log into your account.

An appointed successor can manage your public repositories after presenting a death certificate then waiting for 7 days or presenting an obituary then waiting for 21 days. For more information, see â€œ[{% data variables.product.company_short %} Deceased User Policy](/github/site-policy/github-deceased-user-policy)."

To request access to manage repositories as a successor, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).

## Inviting a successor
The person you invite to be your successor must have a {% data variables.product.company_short %} account.

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.account_settings %}
3. Under "Successor settings", to invite a successor, begin typing a username, full name, or email address, then click their name when it appears.
