When you push commits from the command line, the email address that you've [set in Git](/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address) is associated with your commits. If you enable this setting, each time you push to GitHub, weâ€™ll check the most recent commit. If the author email on that commit is a private email on your GitHub account, we will block the push and warn you about exposing your private email.
