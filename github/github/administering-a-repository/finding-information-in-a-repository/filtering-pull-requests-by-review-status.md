You can filter a repository's list of pull requests to find:
- Pull requests that haven't been [reviewed](/articles/about-pull-request-reviews) yet
- Pull requests that [require a review](/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging) before they can be merged
- Pull requests that a reviewer has approved
- Pull requests in which a reviewer has asked for changes
- Pull requests that you have reviewed
- Pull requests that [someone has asked you, or a team you're a member of, to review](/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review)
