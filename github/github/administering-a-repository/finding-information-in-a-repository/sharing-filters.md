You can send the URL that issues generates to any user, and they'll be able to see the same filter view that you see.

For example, if you filter on issues assigned to Hubot, and sort on the oldest open issues, your URL would update to something like the following:

```
/issues?q=state:open+type:issue+assignee:hubot+sort:created-asc
```
