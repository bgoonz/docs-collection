      You can filter a repository’s list of pull requests to find: - Pull
      requests that haven’t been
      <a href="/articles/about-pull-request-reviews">reviewed</a> yet - Pull
      requests that
      <a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging"
        >require a review</a
      >
      before they can be merged - Pull requests that a reviewer has approved -
      Pull requests in which a reviewer has asked for changes - Pull requests
      that you have reviewed - Pull requests that
      <a href="/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review"
        >someone has asked you, or a team you’re a member of, to review</a
      >
    </p>

      {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} {% data
      reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %} 3. In the upper-right corner, select
      the Reviews drop-down menu.

      4. Choose a filter to find all of the pull requests with that filter’s
      status.
