Use the navigation at the top of the page to view specific lists of branches: - <strong>Your branches</strong>: In repositories that you have push access to, the <strong>Yours</strong> view shows all branches that you’ve pushed to, excluding the default branch, with the most recent branches first. - <strong>Active branches</strong>: The <strong>Active</strong> view shows all branches that anyone has committed to within the last three months, ordered by the branches with the most recent commits first. - <strong>Stale branches</strong>: The <strong>Stale</strong> view shows all branches that no one has committed to in the last three months, ordered by the branches with the oldest commits first. Use this list to determine <a href="/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository">which branches to delete</a>. - <strong>All branches</strong>: The <strong>All</strong> view shows the default branch, followed by all other branches ordered by the branches with the most recent commits first.</p>
