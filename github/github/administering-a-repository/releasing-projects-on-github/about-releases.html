    <p>
      Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make
      available for a wider audience to download and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Releases are based on
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">Git tags</a>,
      which mark a specific point in your repository’s history. A tag date may
      be different than a release date since they can be created at different
      times. For more information about viewing your existing tags, see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags"
        >Viewing your repository’s releases and tags</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can receive notifications when new releases are published in a
      repository without receiving notifications about other updates to the
      repository. For more information, see {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes
      %}“<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions"
        >Viewing your subscriptions</a
      >{% else %}”<a
        href="/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository"
        >Watching and unwatching releases for a repository</a
      >{% endif %}."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone with read access to a repository can view and compare releases, but
      only people with write permissions to a repository can manage releases.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository"
        >Managing releases in a repository</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 or ghae %} People with admin permissions
      to a repository can choose whether {% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the
      ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %}
      creates for each release. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository"
        >Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in
        archives of your repository</a
      >.” {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt %} If a release fixes a security vulnerability, you
      should publish a security advisory in your repository. {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} reviews each published security
      advisory and may use it to send {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to affected repositories.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories"
        >About GitHub Security Advisories</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can view the <strong>Dependents</strong> tab of the dependency graph
      to see which repositories and packages depend on code in your repository,
      and may therefore be affected by a new release. For more information, see
      “<a
        href="/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph"
        >About the dependency graph</a
      >.” {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the Releases API to gather information, such as the
      number of times people download a release asset. For more information, see
      “<a href="/rest/reference/repos#releases">Releases</a>.”
    </p>
    <p>{% ifversion fpt %} ## Storage and bandwidth quotas</p>
    <p>
      Each file included in a release must be under {% data
      variables.large_files.max_file_size %}. There is no limit on the total
      size of a release, nor bandwidth usage.
    </p>
    <p>{% endif %}</p>
