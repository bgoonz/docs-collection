      {% data reusables.pull_requests.configure_pull_request_merges_intro %} You
      can enforce one type of merge method, such as commit squashing or
      rebasing, by only enabling the desired method for your repository.
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.pull_requests.default_merge_option %}</p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %} The default merge method creates a
      merge commit. You can prevent anyone from pushing merge commits to a
      protected branch by enforcing a linear commit history. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-linear-history"
        >About protected branches</a
      >.”{% endif %}

    <h2 id="squashing-your-merge-commits">Squashing your merge commits</h2>
    <p>{% data reusables.pull_requests.squash_and_merge_summary %}</p>
    <p>
      Before enabling squashing commits, consider these disadvantages: - You
      lose information about when specific changes were originally made and who
      authored the squashed commits. - If you continue working on the head
      branch of a pull request after squashing and merging, and then create a
      new pull request between the same branches, commits that you previously
      squashed and merged will be listed in the new pull request. You may also
      have conflicts that you have to repeatedly resolve in each successive pull
      request. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squashing-and-merging-a-long-running-branch"
        >About pull request merges</a
      >.” - Some Git commands that use the “SHA” or “hash” ID may be harder to
      use since the SHA ID for the original commits is lost. For example, using
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere"><code>git rerere</code></a>
      may not be as effective.

      Rebasing and merging your commits
    </h2>
    <p>{% data reusables.pull_requests.rebase_and_merge_summary %}</p>
    <p>
      Before enabling commit rebasing, consider these disadvantages: -
      Repository contributors may have to rebase on the command line, resolve
      any conflicts, and force push their changes to the pull request’s topic
      branch (or remote head branch) before they can use the
      <strong>rebase and merge</strong> option on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}. Force pushing must be done
      carefully so contributors don’t overwrite work that others have based
      their work on. To learn more about when the
      <strong>Rebase and merge</strong> option is disabled on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %} and the workflow to re-enable it,
