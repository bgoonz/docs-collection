## About auto-merge

If you allow auto-merge for pull requests in your repository, people with write permissions can configure individual pull requests in the repository to merge automatically when all merge requirements are met. {% ifversion fpt or ghae-next or ghes > 3.1 %}If someone who does not have write permissions pushes changes to a pull request that has auto-merge enabled, auto-merge will be disabled for that pull request. {% endif %}For more information, see "[Automatically merging a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)."
