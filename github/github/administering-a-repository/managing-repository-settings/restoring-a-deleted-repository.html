<p>Anyone can restore deleted repositories that were owned by their own user account. Organization owners can restore deleted repositories that were owned by the organization.</p>
<h2 id="about-repository-restoration">About repository restoration</h2>
<p>A deleted repository can be restored within 90 days, unless the repository was part of a fork network that is not currently empty. A fork network consists of a parent repository, the repository’s forks, and forks of the repository’s forks. If your repository was part of a fork network, it cannot be restored unless every other repository in the network is deleted or has been detached from the network. For more information about forks, see “<a href="/articles/about-forks">About forks</a>.”</p>
<p>If you want to restore a repository that was part of a fork network that is not currently empty, you can contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.</p>
<p>It can take up to an hour after a repository is deleted before that repository is available for restoration.</p>
<p>Restoring a repository will not restore release attachments or team permissions. Issues that are restored will not be labeled.</p>
