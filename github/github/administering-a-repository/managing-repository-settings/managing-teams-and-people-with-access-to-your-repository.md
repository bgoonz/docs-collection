## About managing access to your repository

For each repository that you administer on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can see an overview of every team or person with access to the repository. From the overview, you can also invite new teams or people, change each team or person's permissions, or remove access to the repository.

This overview can help you audit access to your repository, onboard or off-board contractors or employees, and effectively respond to security incidents.

For more information about repository permission levels, see "[Permission levels for a user account repository](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository)" and "[Repository permission levels for an organization](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization)."
