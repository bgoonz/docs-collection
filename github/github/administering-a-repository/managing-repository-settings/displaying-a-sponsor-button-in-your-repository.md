## About FUNDING files

You can configure your sponsor button by editing a _FUNDING.yml_ file in your repository's `.github` folder, on the default branch. You can configure the button to include sponsored developers in {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, external funding platforms, or a custom funding URL. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, see "[About GitHub Sponsors](/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors)."

You can add one username, package name, or project name per external funding platform and up to four custom URLs. You can add up to four sponsored developers or organizations in {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}. Add each platform on a new line, using the following syntax:

Platform | Syntax
-------- | -----
[LFX Mentorship (formerly CommunityBridge)](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship) | `community_bridge: PROJECT-NAME`
[{% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}](https://github.com/sponsors) | `github: USERNAME` or `github: [USERNAME, USERNAME, USERNAME, USERNAME]`
[IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io/) | `issuehunt: USERNAME`
[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) | `ko_fi: USERNAME`
[Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/) | `liberapay: USERNAME`
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) | `open_collective: USERNAME`
[Otechie](https://otechie.com/)| `otechie: USERNAME`
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) | `patreon: USERNAME`
[Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/) | `tidelift: PLATFORM-NAME/PACKAGE-NAME`
Custom URL | `custom: LINK1` or `custom: [LINK1, LINK2, LINK3, LINK4]`

For Tidelift, use the `platform-name/package-name` syntax with the following platform names:

Language | Platform name
-------- | -------------
JavaScript | `npm`
Python | `pypi`
Ruby | `rubygems`
Java | `maven`
PHP | `packagist`
C# | `nuget`

Here's an example _FUNDING.yml_ file:
```
github: [octocat, surftocat]
patreon: octocat
tidelift: npm/octo-package
custom: ["https://www.paypal.me/octocat", octocat.com]
```

{% note %}

**Note:** If a custom URL in an array includes `:`, you must wrap the URL in quotes. For example, `"https://www.paypal.me/octocat"`.

{% endnote %}

You can create a default sponsor button for your organization or user account. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

{% note %}

Funding links provide a way for open source projects to receive direct financial support from their community. We donâ€™t support the use of funding links for other purposes, such as for advertising, or supporting political, community, or charity groups. If you have questions about whether your intended use is supported, please contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.
