## About branch protection rules

{% data reusables.repositories.branch-rules-example %}

You can create a rule for all current and future branches in your repository with the wildcard syntax `*`. Because {% data variables.product.company_short %} uses the `File::FNM_PATHNAME` flag for the `File.fnmatch` syntax, the wildcard does not match directory separators (`/`). For example, `qa/*` will match all branches beginning with `qa/` and containing a single slash. You can include multiple slashes with `qa/**/*`, and you can extend the `qa` string with `qa**/**/*` to make the rule more inclusive. For more information about syntax options for branch rules, see the [fnmatch documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).

If a repository has multiple protected branch rules that affect the same branches, the rules that include a specific branch name have the highest priority. If there is more than one protected branch rule that references the same specific branch name, then the branch rule created first will have higher priority.

Protected branch rules that mention a special character, such as `*`, `?`, or `]`, are applied in the order they were created, so older rules with these characters have a higher priority.

To create an exception to an existing branch rule, you can create a new branch protection rule that is higher priority, such as a branch rule for a specific branch name. 

For more information about each of each of the available branch protection settings, see "[About protected branches](/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)."

## Creating a branch protection rule

When you create a branch rule, the branch you specify doesn't have to exist yet in the repository.

1. Optionally, enable required pull request reviews.
   - Under "Protect matching branches", select **Require pull request reviews before merging**.
     ![Pull request review restriction checkbox](/assets/images/help/repository/PR-reviews-required.png)
   - Click the **Required approving reviews** drop-down menu, then select the number of approving reviews you'd like to require on the branch.

   - Optionally, if the repository is part of an organization, select **Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews**. Then, search for and select the people or teams who are allowed to dismiss pull request reviews. For more information, see "[Dismissing a pull request review](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review)."
