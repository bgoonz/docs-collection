    <p>
      You can enforce certain workflows or requirements before a collaborator
      can push changes to a branch in your repository, including merging a pull
      request into the branch, by creating a branch protection rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, each branch protection rule disables force pushes to the
      matching branches and prevents the matching branches from being deleted.
      You can optionally disable these restrictions and enable additional branch
      protection settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, the restrictions of a branch protection rule don’t apply to
      people with admin permissions to the repository. You can optionally choose
      to include administrators, too.
    </p>

    <h3 id="require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging">
      Require pull request reviews before merging
    </h3>
    <p>{% data reusables.pull_requests.required-reviews-for-prs-summary %}</p>
    <p>
      If you enable required reviews, collaborators can only push changes to a
      protected branch via a pull request that is approved by the required
      number of reviewers with write permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a person with admin permissions chooses the
      <strong>Request changes</strong> option in a review, then that person must
      approve the pull request before the pull request can be merged. If a
      reviewer who requests changes on a pull request isn’t available, anyone
      with write permissions for the repository can dismiss the blocking review.
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.repositories.review-policy-overlapping-commits %}</p>
    <p>
      If a collaborator attempts to merge a pull request with pending or
      rejected reviews into the protected branch, the collaborator will receive
      an error message.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
remote: error: Changes have been requested.</code></pre>
    <p>
      Optionally, you can choose to dismiss stale pull request approvals when
      commits are pushed. If anyone pushes a commit that modifies code to an
      approved pull request, the approval will be dismissed, and the pull
      request cannot be merged. This doesn’t apply if the collaborator pushes
      commits that don’t modify code, like merging the base branch into the pull
      request’s branch. For information about the base branch, see “<a
        href="/articles/about-pull-requests"
        >About pull requests</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Optionally, you can restrict the ability to dismiss pull request reviews
      to specific people or teams. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/dismissing-a-pull-request-review"
        >Dismissing a pull request review</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Optionally, you can choose to require reviews from code owners. If you do,
      any pull request that affects code with a code owner must be approved by
      that code owner before the pull request can be merged into the protected
      branch.
    </p>
    <h3 id="require-status-checks-before-merging">
      Require status checks before merging
    </h3>
    <p>
      Required status checks ensure that all required CI tests are passing
      before collaborators can make changes to a protected branch. Required
      status checks can be checks or statuses. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks"
        >About status checks</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you can enable required status checks, you must configure the
      repository to use the status API. For more information, see “<a
        href="/rest/reference/repos#statuses"
        >Repositories</a
      >” in the REST documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After enabling required status checks, all required status checks must
      pass before collaborators can merge changes into the protected branch.
      After all required status checks pass, any commits must either be pushed
      to another branch and then merged or pushed directly to the protected
      branch.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Any person or integration with write permissions to
      a repository can set the state of any status check in the repository. {%
      data variables.product.company_short %} does not verify that the author of
      a check is authorized to create a check with a certain name or modify an
      existing status. Before merging a pull request, you should verify that the
      author of each status, listed in the merge box, is expected.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      You can set up required status checks to either be “loose” or “strict.”
      The type of required status check you choose determines whether your
      branch is required to be up to date with the base branch before merging.

    <h3 id="require-linear-history">Require linear history</h3>
    <p>
      Enforcing a linear commit history prevents collaborators from pushing
      merge commits to the branch. This means that any pull requests merged into
      the protected branch must use a squash merge or a rebase merge. A strictly
      linear commit history can help teams reverse changes more easily. For more
      information about merge methods, see “<a
        href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges"
        >About pull request merges</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you can require a linear commit history, your repository must allow
      squash merging or rebase merging. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges"
        >Configuring pull request merges</a

    <h3 id="include-administrators">Include administrators</h3>
    <p>
      By default, protected branch rules do not apply to people with admin
      permissions to a repository. You can enable this setting to include
      administrators in your protected branch rules.
    </p>
    <h3 id="restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches">

    </p>
    <p>
      When you enable branch restrictions, only users, teams, or apps that have
      been given permission can push to the protected branch. You can view and
      edit the users, teams, or apps with push access to a protected branch in
      the protected branch’s settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can only give push access to a protected branch to users, teams, or
      installed {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} with write
      access to a repository. People and apps with admin permissions to a
      repository are always able to push to a protected branch.
    </p>
    <h3 id="allow-force-pushes">Allow force pushes</h3>
    <p>
      By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} blocks force pushes
      on all protected branches. When you enable force pushes to a protected
      branch, anyone with at least write permissions to the repository can force
      push to the branch, including those with admin permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enabling force pushes will not override any other branch protection rules.
      For example, if a branch requires a linear commit history, you cannot
      force push merge commits to that branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion ghes or ghae %}You cannot enable force pushes for a protected
