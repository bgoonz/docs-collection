## About support entitlements

People with support entitlements for your enterprise account can use the support portal to open, view, and comment on support tickets associated with the enterprise account.

Enterprise owners and billing managers automatically have a support entitlement. Enterprise owners can add support entitlements to members of organizations owned by their enterprise account.

## Adding a support entitlement to an enterprise member

{% note %}

**Note**: After you add a support entitlement, the enterprise member may need to sign out and sign in again to manage tickets.

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.settings-tab %}
3. Under "Settings", click **Support**.
