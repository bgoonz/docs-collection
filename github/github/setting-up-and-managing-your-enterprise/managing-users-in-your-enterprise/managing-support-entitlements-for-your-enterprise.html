    <p>
      People with support entitlements for your enterprise account can use the
      support portal to open, view, and comment on support tickets associated
      with the enterprise account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enterprise owners and billing managers automatically have a support
      entitlement. Enterprise owners can add support entitlements to members of
      organizations owned by their enterprise account.
