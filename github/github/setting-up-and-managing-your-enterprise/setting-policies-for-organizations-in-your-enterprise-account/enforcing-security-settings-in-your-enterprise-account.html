      Requiring two-factor authentication for organizations in your enterprise
      account
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enterprise owners can require that organization members, billing managers,
      and outside collaborators in all organizations owned by an enterprise
      account use two-factor authentication to secure their personal accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you can require 2FA for all organizations owned by your enterprise
      account, you must enable two-factor authentication for your own account.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/"
        >Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you require two-factor authentication for your enterprise account,
        members, outside collaborators, and billing managers (including bot
        accounts) in all organizations owned by your enterprise account who do
        not use 2FA will be removed from the organization and lose access to its
        repositories. They will also lose access to their forks of the
        organization’s private repositories. You can reinstate their access
        privileges and settings if they enable two-factor authentication for
        their personal account within three months of their removal from your
        organization. For more information, see “<a
          href="/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization"
          >Reinstating a former member of your organization</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Any organization owner, member, billing manager, or outside collaborator
        in any of the organizations owned by your enterprise account who
        disables 2FA for their personal account after you’ve enabled required
        two-factor authentication will automatically be removed from the
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re the sole owner of a enterprise account that requires
        two-factor authentication, you won’t be able to disable 2FA for your
        personal account without disabling required two-factor authentication
        for the enterprise account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <p>
      Before you require use of two-factor authentication, we recommend
      notifying organization members, outside collaborators, and billing
      managers and asking them to set up 2FA for their accounts. Organization
      owners can see if members and outside collaborators already use 2FA on
      each organization’s People page. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/viewing-whether-users-in-your-organization-have-2fa-enabled"
        >Viewing whether users in your organization have 2FA enabled</a
      >.”

      6. If prompted, read the information about members and outside
      collaborators who will be removed from the organizations owned by your
      enterprise account. To confirm the change, type your enterprise account’s
      name, then click
      <strong>Remove members &amp; require two-factor authentication</strong>.

      7. Optionally, if any members or outside collaborators are removed from
      the organizations owned by your enterprise account, we recommend sending
      them an invitation to reinstate their former privileges and access to your
      organization. Each person must enable two-factor authentication before
      they can accept your invitation.
