<h2 id="requiring-two-factor-authentication-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account">Requiring two-factor authentication for organizations in your enterprise account</h2>
<p>Enterprise owners can require that organization members, billing managers, and outside collaborators in all organizations owned by an enterprise account use two-factor authentication to secure their personal accounts.</p>
<p>Before you can require 2FA for all organizations owned by your enterprise account, you must enable two-factor authentication for your own account. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/">Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)</a>.”</p>
<p>{% warning %}</p>
<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you require two-factor authentication for your enterprise account, members, outside collaborators, and billing managers (including bot accounts) in all organizations owned by your enterprise account who do not use 2FA will be removed from the organization and lose access to its repositories. They will also lose access to their forks of the organization’s private repositories. You can reinstate their access privileges and settings if they enable two-factor authentication for their personal account within three months of their removal from your organization. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization">Reinstating a former member of your organization</a>.”</li>
<li>Any organization owner, member, billing manager, or outside collaborator in any of the organizations owned by your enterprise account who disables 2FA for their personal account after you’ve enabled required two-factor authentication will automatically be removed from the organization.</li>
<li>If you’re the sole owner of a enterprise account that requires two-factor authentication, you won’t be able to disable 2FA for your personal account without disabling required two-factor authentication for the enterprise account.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% endwarning %}</p>
<p>Before you require use of two-factor authentication, we recommend notifying organization members, outside collaborators, and billing managers and asking them to set up 2FA for their accounts. Organization owners can see if members and outside collaborators already use 2FA on each organization’s People page. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/viewing-whether-users-in-your-organization-have-2fa-enabled">Viewing whether users in your organization have 2FA enabled</a>.”</p>

Optionally, if any members or outside collaborators are removed from the organizations owned by your enterprise account, we recommend sending them an invitation to reinstate their former privileges and access to your organization. Each person must enable two-factor authentication before they can accept your invitation.</p>
