For {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the second form of authentication is a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device{% ifversion fpt %} or sent as a text message (SMS){% endif %}. After you enable 2FA, {% data variables.product.product_name %} generates an authentication code any time someone attempts to sign into your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they know both your password and have access to the authentication code on your phone.

You can also configure additional recovery methods in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials. For more information on setting up 2FA, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[Configuring two-factor authentication recovery methods](/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods)."

We **strongly** urge you to enable 2FA for the safety of your account, not only on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, but on other websites and apps that support 2FA. You can enable 2FA to access {% data variables.product.product_name %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}.

For more information, see "[Accessing {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} using two-factor authentication](/articles/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication)."
