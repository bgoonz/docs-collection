<p>We strongly recommend using two-factor authentication to secure your account. If you need to disable 2FA, we recommend re-enabling it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>{% warning %}</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you’re a member{% ifversion fpt %}, billing manager,{% endif %} or outside collaborator to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication and you disable 2FA, you’ll be automatically removed from the organization, and you’ll lose your access to their repositories. To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.</p>
<p>{% endwarning %}</p>
<p>If your organization requires two-factor authentication and you’re a member, owner, or an outside collaborator on a private repository of your organization, you must first leave your organization before you can disable two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>To remove yourself from your organization: - As an organization member or owner, see “<a href="/articles/removing-yourself-from-an-organization/">Removing yourself from an organization</a>.” - As an outside collaborator, ask an organization owner or repository administrator to remove you from the organization’s repositories. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/viewing-people-s-roles-in-an-organization">Viewing people’s roles in an organization</a>” and “<a href="/articles/removing-an-outside-collaborator-from-an-organization-repository/">Removing an outside collaborator from an organization repository</a>.”</p>
