We strongly recommend using two-factor authentication to secure your account. If you need to disable 2FA, we recommend re-enabling it as soon as possible.

{% warning %}

**Warning:** If you're a member{% ifversion fpt %}, billing manager,{% endif %} or outside collaborator to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication and you disable 2FA, you'll be automatically removed from the organization, and you'll lose your access to their repositories. To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.

{% endwarning %}

If your organization requires two-factor authentication and you're a member, owner, or an outside collaborator on a private repository of your organization, you must first leave your organization before you can disable two-factor authentication.

To remove yourself from your organization:
 - As an organization member or owner, see "[Removing yourself from an organization](/articles/removing-yourself-from-an-organization/)."
 - As an outside collaborator, ask an organization owner or repository administrator to remove you from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "[Viewing people's roles in an organization](/articles/viewing-people-s-roles-in-an-organization)" and "[Removing an outside collaborator from an organization repository](/articles/removing-an-outside-collaborator-from-an-organization-repository/)."
