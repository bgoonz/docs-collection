      When a third-party application wants to identify you by your {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} login, you’ll see a page with the
      developer contact information and a list of the specific data that’s being
      requested.

    <h2 id="contacting-the-application-developer">
      Contacting the application developer
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because an application is developed by a third-party who isn’t {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}, we don’t know exactly how an
      application uses the data it’s requesting access to. You can use the
      developer information at the top of the page to contact the application
      admin if you have questions or concerns about their application.

      Types of application access and data

    <p>
      Applications can have <em>read</em> or <em>write</em> access to your {%
      data variables.product.product_name %} data.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Read access</strong> only allows an application to
        <em>look at</em> your data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Write access</strong> allows an application to
        <em>change</em> your data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="about-oauth-scopes">About OAuth scopes</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Scopes</em> are named groups of permissions that an application can
      request to access both public and non-public data.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you want to use a third-party application that integrates with {%
      data variables.product.product_name %}, that application lets you know
      what type of access to your data will be required. If you grant access to
      the application, then the application will be able to perform actions on
      your behalf, such as reading or modifying data. For example, if you want
      to use an app that requests <code>user:email</code> scope, the app will
      have read-only access to your private email addresses. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps"
        >About scopes for {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}</a
      >.”
