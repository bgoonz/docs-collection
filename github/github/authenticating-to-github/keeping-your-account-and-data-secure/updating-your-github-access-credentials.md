## Requesting a new password

1. To request a new password, visit {% ifversion fpt %}https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset{% else %}`https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset`{% endif %}.
2. Enter the email address associated with your personal {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, then click **Send password reset email.** The email will be sent to the backup email address if you have one configured.

3. We'll email you a link that will allow you to reset your password. You must click on this link within 3 hours of receiving the email. If you didn't receive an email from us, make sure to check your spam folder.
4. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will be prompted for your 2FA credentials. Type your 2FA credentials or one of your 2FA recovery codes and click **Verify**.

{% tip %}

To avoid losing your password in the future, we suggest using a secure password manager, like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), or [Keeper](https://keepersecurity.com/).

{% endtip %}

## Changing an existing password

{% data reusables.repositories.blocked-passwords %}

1. {% data variables.product.signin_link %} to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.security %}
4. Under "Change password", type your old password, a strong new password, and confirm your new password. For help creating a strong password, see "[Creating a strong password](/articles/creating-a-strong-password)"
5. Click **Update password**.

{% tip %}

For greater security, enable two-factor authentication in addition to changing your password. See [About two-factor authentication](/articles/about-two-factor-authentication) for more details.

## Updating your SSH keys

## Resetting API tokens
