3. Check the command output to see if you have a GPG key pair.
    * If there are no GPG key pairs or you don't want to use any that are available for signing commits and tags, then [generate a new GPG key](/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key).
    * If there's an existing GPG key pair and you want to use it to sign commits and tags, then [add your GPG key to your GitHub account](/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).
