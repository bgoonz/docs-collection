## Telling Git about your GPG key

If you're using a GPG key that matches your committer identity and your verified email address associated with your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, then you can begin signing commits and signing tags.

{% note %}

If you don't have a GPG key that matches your committer identity, you need to associate an email with an existing key. For more information, see "[Associating an email with your GPG key](/articles/associating-an-email-with-your-gpg-key)".

{% endnote %}

If you have multiple GPG keys, you need to tell Git which one to use.

{% data reusables.gpg.list-keys-with-note %}
{% data reusables.gpg.copy-gpg-key-id %}
{% data reusables.gpg.paste-gpg-key-id %}
1. If you aren't using the GPG suite, run the following command in the `zsh` shell to add the GPG key to your `.zshrc` file, if it exists, or your `.zprofile` file:
  ```shell
  $ if [ -r ~/.zshrc ]; then echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.zshrc; \
    else echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.zprofile; fi
  ```
  Alternatively, if you use the `bash` shell, run this command:
  ```shell
  $ if [ -r ~/.bash_profile ]; then echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.bash_profile; \
    else echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.profile; fi
  ```

1. To add your GPG key to your bash profile, run the following command:
  ```shell
  $ if [ -r ~/.bash_profile ]; then echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.bash_profile; \
    else echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.profile; fi
  ```
  {% note %}

  **Note:** If you don't have `.bash_profile`, this command adds your GPG key to `.profile`.
