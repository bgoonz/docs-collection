      Commits and tags may contain several email addresses. For commits, there
      is the author — the person who wrote the code — and the committer — the
      person who added the commit to the tree. When signing a commit with Git,
      whether it be during a merge, cherry-pick, or normal
      <code>git commit</code>, the committer email address will be yours, even
      if the author email address isn’t. Tags are more simple: The tagger email
      address is always the user who created the tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to change your committer or tagger email address, see “<a
        href="/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address/"
        >Setting your commit email address</a
      >.”
