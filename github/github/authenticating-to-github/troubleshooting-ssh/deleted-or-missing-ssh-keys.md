{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically deletes inactive SSH keys to help keep accounts safe, such as after someone leaves a job or loses a computer.

You can check if you haven't used an SSH key in a year by reviewing your account's security log. For more information, see "[Reviewing your security log](/articles/reviewing-your-security-log/)."

After your inactive SSH key is deleted, you must generate a new SSH key and associate it with your account. For more information, see "[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)" and "[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)."
