    <p>The error you receive may look like the following:</p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ git push -u github.main
&gt; fatal: &#39;github.main&#39; does not appear to be a git repository
&gt; fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

$ git pull -u github
&gt; error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
&gt; error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed while accessing https://github.com/tqisjim/google-oauth.git/info/refs
&gt; fatal: HTTP request failed</code></pre>
    <p>
      A “CA” is shorthand for a “certificate authority,” a third-party group
      responsible for handling secure connections around the web. They establish
      digital “certificates,” which are a way of ensuring that there are valid
      connections between two machines (like your computer and GitHub.com).
      Without a certificate, the security risk between two machines is greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you receive this error, it likely means that your CA is out-of-date
      and needs to be updated. Generally, updating your operating system also
      updates your CA, and solves the problem.
