If you [configured your SSH passphrase with the macOS keychain](/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#saving-your-passphrase-in-the-keychain), you may be able to recover it.

1. In Finder, search for the **Keychain Access** app.

2. In Keychain Access, search for **SSH**.
3. Double click on the entry for your SSH key to open a new dialog box.
4. In the lower-left corner, select **Show password**.

6. Your password will be revealed.

If you lose your SSH key passphrase, there's no way to recover it. You'll need to [generate a brand new SSH keypair](/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) or [switch to HTTPS cloning](/github/getting-started-with-github/managing-remote-repositories) so you can use your GitHub password instead.
