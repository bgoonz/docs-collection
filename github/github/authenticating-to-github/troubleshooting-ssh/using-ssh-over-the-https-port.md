title: Using SSH over the HTTPS port
intro: 'Sometimes, firewalls refuse to allow SSH connections entirely.  If using [HTTPS cloning with credential caching](/github/getting-started-with-github/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) is not an option, you can attempt to clone using an SSH connection made over the HTTPS port.  Most firewall rules should allow this, but proxy servers may interfere.'

{% tip %}

**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} users**: Accessing {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} via SSH over the HTTPS port is currently not supported.

{% endtip %}

To test if SSH over the HTTPS port is possible, run this SSH command:

```shell
$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
> Hi <em>username</em>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
```

If that worked, great! If not, you may need to [follow our troubleshooting guide](/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey).

## Enabling SSH connections over HTTPS

If you are able to SSH into `git@ssh.{% data variables.command_line.backticks %}` over port 443, you can override your SSH settings to force any connection to {% data variables.product.product_location %} to run though that server and port.

To set this in your ssh config, edit the file at `~/.ssh/config`, and add this section:

```
Host {% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}
  Hostname ssh.{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}
  Port 443
  User git
```

You can test that this works by connecting once more to {% data variables.product.product_location %}:

```shell
$ ssh -T git@{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}
> Hi <em>username</em>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
```
