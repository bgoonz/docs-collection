  **Note:** When you revoke a session, you remove your SAML authentication to that organization. To access the organization again, you will need to single sign-on through your identity provider. For more information, see "[About authentication with SAML SSO](/github/authenticating-to-github/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on)."
