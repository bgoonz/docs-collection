You can authorize an existing SSH key, or create a new SSH key and then authorize it. For more information about creating a new SSH key, see "[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)."

{% note %}

**Note:** If your SSH key authorization is revoked by an organization, you will not be able to reauthorize the same key. You will need to create a new SSH key and authorize it. For more information about creating a new SSH key, see "[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)."
