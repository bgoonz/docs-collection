**Tips:**

- File finder results exclude some directories like `build`, `log`, `tmp`, and `vendor`. To search for files within these directories, use the [`filename` code search qualifier](/articles/searching-code#search-by-filename).
- You can also open the file finder by pressing `t` on your keyboard. For more information, see "[Keyboard shortcuts](/articles/keyboard-shortcuts)."
