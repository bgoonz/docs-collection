To show forks in [repository search](/articles/searching-for-repositories) results, add `fork:true` or `fork:only` to your query.

Forks are only indexed for [code search](/articles/searching-code) when they have more stars than the parent repository. You will not be able to search the code in a fork that has less stars than its parent. To show forks with more stars than the parent repository in code search results, add `fork:true` or `fork:only` to your query.

The `fork:true` qualifier finds all results that match your search query, including forks. The `fork:only` qualifier finds _only_ forks that match your search query.

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `fork:true` | [**github fork:true**](https://github.com/search?q=github+fork%3Atrue&type=Repositories) matches all repositories containing the word "github," including forks.
| | [**android language:java fork:true**](https://github.com/search?q=android+language%3Ajava+fork%3Atrue&type=Code) matches code with the word "android" that's written in Java, in both forks and regular repositories.
| `fork:only` | [**github fork:only**](https://github.com/search?q=github+fork%3Aonly&type=Repositories) matches all fork repositories containing the word "github."
| | [**forks:>500 fork:only**](https://github.com/search?q=forks%3A%3E500+fork%3Aonly&type=Repositories) matches repositories with more than 500 forks, and only returns those that are forks.
