You can search for repositories globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_location %}, or search for repositories within a particular organization. For more information, see "[About searching on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/articles/about-searching-on-github)."

To include forks in the search results, you will need to add `fork:true` or `fork:only` to your query. For more information, see "[Searching in forks](/articles/searching-in-forks)."

{% data reusables.search.syntax_tips %}

## Search by repository name, description, or contents of the README file

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search to the repository name, repository description, contents of the README file, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the repository name and description are searched.

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `in:name` | [**jquery in:name**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Aname&type=Repositories) matches repositories with "jquery" in the repository name.
| `in:description`  | [**jquery in:name,description**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Aname%2Cdescription&type=Repositories) matches repositories with "jquery" in the repository name or description.
| `in:readme` | [**jquery in:readme**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Areadme&type=Repositories) matches repositories mentioning "jquery" in the repository's README file.
| `repo:owner/name` | [**repo:octocat/hello-world**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aoctocat%2Fhello-world) matches a specific repository name.

## Search based on the contents of a repository

You can find a repository by searching for content in the repository's README file using the `in:readme` qualifier. For more information, see "[About READMEs](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes)."

Besides using `in:readme`, it's not possible to find repositories by searching for specific content within the repository. To search for a specific file or content within a repository, you can use the file finder or code-specific search qualifiers. For more information, see "[Finding files on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/articles/finding-files-on-github)" and "[Searching code](/articles/searching-code)."

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `in:readme` | [**octocat in:readme**](https://github.com/search?q=octocat+in%3Areadme&type=Repositories) matches repositories mentioning "octocat" in the repository's README file.

## Search within a user's or organization's repositories

To search in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the  `user` or `org` qualifier.

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>user:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**user:defunkt forks:&gt;100**](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Adefunkt+forks%3A%3E%3D100&type=Repositories) matches repositories from @defunkt that have more than 100 forks.
| <code>org:<em>ORGNAME</em></code> | [**org:github**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Agithub&type=Repositories) matches repositories from GitHub.

## Search by repository size

The `size` qualifier finds repositories that match a certain size (in kilobytes), using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For more information, see "[Understanding the search syntax](/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)."

| | [**size:&lt;50**](https://github.com/search?q=size%3A%3C50&type=Repositories) matches repositories that are smaller than 50 KB.
| | [**size:50..120**](https://github.com/search?q=size%3A50..120&type=Repositories) matches repositories that are between 50 KB and 120 KB.

## Search by number of followers

You can filter repositories based on the number of users who follow the repositories, using the `followers` qualifier with greater than, less than, and range qualifiers.

## Search by number of forks

The `forks` qualifier specifies the number of forks a repository should have, using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For more information, see "[Understanding the search syntax](/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)."

## Search by when a repository was created or last updated

You can filter repositories based on time of creation or time of last update. For repository creation, you can use the `created` qualifier; to find out when a repository was last updated, you'll want to use the `pushed` qualifier. The `pushed` qualifier will return a list of repositories, sorted by the most recent commit made on any branch in the repository.

Both take a date as a parameter. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}
