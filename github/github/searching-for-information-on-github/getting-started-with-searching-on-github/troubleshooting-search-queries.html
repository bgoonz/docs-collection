    <h2 id="potential-timeouts">Potential timeouts</h2>
    <p>
      Some queries are computationally expensive for our search infrastructure
      to execute. To keep search fast for everyone, we limit how long any
      individual query can run. In rare situations when a query exceeds the time
      limit, search returns all matches that were found prior to the timeout and
      informs you that a timeout occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are
      incomplete. It just means that the query was discontinued before it
      searched through all possible data.
    </p>
    <h2 id="limitations-on-query-length">Limitations on query length</h2>
    <p>
      There are some limits to the length of the queries when searching across
      {% data variables.product.product_name %}:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Queries longer than 256 characters are not supported</li>
      <li>
        You can’t construct a query using more than five <code>AND</code>,
        <code>OR</code>, or <code>NOT</code> operators
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Specific search types, such as code search, might have additional
      limitations. Check the documentation for these search types for more
      information.
