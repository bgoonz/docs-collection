{% data variables.product.product_name %} stores repository and profile metadata from your personal account's activity. You can export your personal account's data through settings on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} or with the User Migration API.

For more information about the data {% data variables.product.product_name %} stores that is available for exporting, see "[Download a user migration archive](/rest/reference/migrations#download-a-user-migration-archive)" and "[About {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s use of your data](/articles/about-github-s-use-of-your-data).

When you request an export of your personal data through settings on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, {% data variables.product.product_name %} packages your personal data in a `tar.gz` file and sends you an email to your primary email address with a download link.

By default, the download link expires after seven days. At any time before the download link expires, you can disable the link from your user settings. For more information, see "[Deleting access to an archive of your personal account's data](/articles/requesting-an-archive-of-your-personal-account-s-data/#deleting-access-to-an-archive-of-your-personal-accounts-data)."

If your operating system cannot natively unpack the `tar.gz` file, you can use a third-party tool to extract the archived files. For more information, see "[How to unzip a tar.gz file](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/how-unzip-targz-file)" on Opensource.com.

The generated `tar.gz` file reflects the data stored at the time you started the data export.
