      The notifications inbox on {% data variables.product.product_name %}{%
      ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 2.22 %} and {% data
      variables.product.prodname_mobile %}{% endif %} includes triaging options
      designed specifically for your {% data variables.product.product_name %}
      notifications flow, including options to: - Triage multiple notifications
      at once. - Mark completed notifications as <strong>Done</strong> and
      remove them from your inbox. To view all of your notifications marked as
      <strong>Done</strong>, use the <code>is:done</code> query. - Save a
      notification to review later. Saved notifications are flagged in your
      inbox and kept indefinitely. To view all of your saved notifications, use
      the <code>is:saved</code> query. - Unsubscribe and remove a notification
      from your inbox. - Preview the issue, pull request, or team discussion
      where the notification originates on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} from within the notifications inbox. -
      See one of the latest reasons you’re receiving a notification from your
      inbox with a <code>reasons</code> label. - Create custom filters to focus
      on different notifications when you want. - Group notifications in your
      inbox by repository or date to get a quick overview with less context

      Benefits of using an email client for notifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      One benefit of using an email client is that all of your notifications can
      be kept indefinitely depending on your email client’s storage capacity.
      Your inbox notifications are only kept for 5 months on {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} unless you’ve marked them as
      <strong>Saved</strong>. <strong>Saved</strong> notifications are kept
      indefinitely. For more information about your inbox’s retention policy,
      see “<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications#notification-retention-policy"
        >About notifications</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sending notifications to your email client also allows you to customize
      your inbox according to your email client’s settings, which can include
      custom or color-coded labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email notifications also allow flexibility with the types of notifications
      you receive and allow you to choose different email addresses for updates.
      For example, you can send certain notifications for a repository to a
      verified personal email address. For more information, about your email
      customization options, see “<a
        href="#customizing-your-email-notifications"
        >Customizing your email notifications</a

    <h2 id="about-participating-and-watching-notifications">
      About participating and watching notifications
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you watch a repository, you’re subscribing to updates for activity in
      that repository. Similarly, when you watch a specific team’s discussions,
      you’re subscribing to all conversation updates on that team’s page. For
      more information, see “<a

      To see repositories that you’re watching, go to your

      information, see “<a

      {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 or ghae-next %} ### About custom
      notifications You can customize notifications for a repository. For
      example, you can choose to only be notified when updates to one or more

      Anytime you comment in a conversation or when someone

      username, you are <em>participating</em> in a conversation. By default,
      you are automatically subscribed to a conversation when you participate in
      it. You can unsubscribe from a conversation you’ve participated in
      manually by clicking <strong>Unsubscribe</strong> on the issue or pull
      request or through the <strong>Unsubscribe</strong> option in the
      notifications inbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      For conversations you’re watching or participating in, you can choose
      whether you want to receive notifications by email or through the
      notifications inbox on {% data variables.product.product_name %}{%
      ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 2.22 %} and {% data
      variables.product.prodname_mobile %}{% endif %}.

      For example: - If you don’t want notifications to be sent to your email,
      unselect <strong>email</strong> for participating and watching
      notifications. - If you want to receive notifications by email when you’ve
      participated in a conversation, then you can select
      <strong>email</strong> under “Participating”.

      After enabling email notifications, {% data variables.product.product_name

      HTML and plain text copies of the content. Email notification content
      includes any Markdown,
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentions">@mentions</span>, emojis,
      hash-links, and more, that appear in the original content on {% data

      Choose a default email address where you want to send updates for
      conversations you’re participating in or watching. You can also specify
      which activity on {% data variables.product.product_name %} you want to
      receive updates for using your default email address. For example, choose
      whether you want updates to your default email from: - Comments on issues
      and pull requests. - Pull request reviews. - Pull request pushes. - Your
      own updates, such as when you open, comment on, or close an issue or pull
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the organization that owns the repository, you can also send
      notifications to different email addresses. Your organization may require
      the email address to be verified for a specific domain. For more

      Each email notification that {% data variables.product.product_name %}
      sends contains header information. The header information in every email
      is consistent, so you can use it in your email client to filter or forward
      all {% data variables.product.product_name %} notifications, or certain
      types of {% data variables.product.product_name %} notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe you’re receiving notifications that don’t belong to you,
      examine the <code>X-GitHub-Recipient</code> and
      <code>X-GitHub-Recipient-Address</code> headers. These headers show who
      the intended recipient is. Depending on your email setup, you may receive
      notifications intended for another user.

      Email notifications from {% data variables.product.product_name %} contain
      the following header information:
