      Notifications and subscriptions
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can choose to receive ongoing updates about specific activity on {%
      data variables.product.product_name %} through a subscription.
      Notifications are updates that you receive for specific activity that you
      are subscribed to.
    </p>
    <h3 id="subscription-options">Subscription options</h3>
    <p>
      You can choose to subscribe to notifications for: - A conversation in a
      specific issue, pull request, or gist. - All activity in a repository or
      team discussion. - CI activity, such as the status of workflows in
      repositories set up with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. {%
      ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 or ghae-next %} - Repository {% data
      reusables.notifications-v2.custom-notification-types %} (if enabled). {%
      elsif ghae or ghes %} - Releases in a repository.{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also choose to automatically watch all repositories that you have
      push access to, except forks. You can watch any other repository you have
      access to manually by clicking <strong>Watch</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe,
      unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you’ll receive in the
      future. For example, if you no longer want to receive notifications from a
      particular repository, you can click <strong>Unsubscribe</strong>. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-your-subscriptions"
        >Managing your subscriptions</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="default-subscriptions">Default subscriptions</h3>
    <p>
      In general, you are automatically subscribed to conversations by default
      when you have: - Not disabled automatic watching for repositories or teams
      you’ve joined in your notification settings. This setting is enabled by
      default. - Been assigned to an issue or pull request. - Opened a pull
      request, issue, or created a team discussion post. - Commented on a
      thread. - Subscribed to a thread manually by clicking
      <strong>Watch</strong> or <strong>Subscribe</strong>. - Had your username
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentioned">@mentioned</span>. - Changed
      the state of a thread, such as by closing an issue or merging a pull
      request. - Had a team you’re a member of
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentioned">@mentioned</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, you also automatically watch all repositories that you create
      and are owned by your user account.
    </p>
    <p>
      To unsubscribe from conversations you’re automatically subscribed to, you
      can change your notification settings or directly unsubscribe or unwatch
      activity on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more
      information, see “<a

      at
      <a href="https://github.com/notifications"
        >https://github.com/notifications</a
      >{% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 2.22 %} and in the {% data

      To customize the types of updates you’d like to receive and where to send
      those updates, configure your notification settings. For more information,
      see “<a

        >Configuring notifications</a

      To keep your subscriptions manageable, review your subscriptions and
      watched repositories and unsubscribe as needed. For more information, see

      Reasons for receiving notifications
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your inbox is configured with default filters, which represent the most
      common reasons that people need to follow-up on their notifications. For
      more information about inbox filters, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-notifications-from-your-inbox#default-notification-filters"
        >Managing notifications from your inbox</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Your inbox shows the <code>reasons</code> you’re receiving notifications
      as a label.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Reasons labels in inbox</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can filter your inbox by the reason you’re subscribed to
      notifications. For example, to only see pull requests where someone
      requested your review, you can use the <code>review-requested</code> query
      filter.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’ve configured notifications to be sent by email and believe you’re
      receiving notifications that don’t belong to you, consider troubleshooting
      with email headers, which show the intended recipient. For more
      information, see “<a

    <h2 id="triaging-notifications-from-your-inbox">
      Triaging notifications from your inbox
    </h2>
    <p>
      To effectively manage your notifications, you can triage your inbox with
      options to: - Remove a notification from the inbox with
      <strong>Done</strong>. You can review <strong>Done</strong> notifications
      all in one place by clicking <strong>Done</strong> in the sidebar or by
      using the query <code>is:done</code>. - Mark a notification as read or
      unread. - <strong>Save</strong> a notification for later review.
      <strong>Saved</strong> notifications are flagged in your inbox. You can
      review <strong>Saved</strong> notifications all in one place in the
      sidebar by clicking <strong>Saved</strong> or by using the query
      <code>is:saved</code>. - Automatically unsubscribe from this notification
      and future updates from this conversation. Unsubscribing also removes the
      notification from your inbox. If you unsubscribe from a conversation and
      someone mentions your username or a team you’re on that you’re receiving
      updates for, then you will start to receive notifications from this
      conversation again.
    </p>
    <p>
      From your inbox you can also triage multiple notifications at once. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-notifications-from-your-inbox#triaging-multiple-notifications-at-the-same-time"

    <h2 id="customizing-your-notifications-inbox">
      Customizing your notifications inbox

    <p>
      To focus on a group of notifications in your inbox on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}{% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 2.22 %} or
      {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}{% endif %}, you can create
      custom filters. For example, you can create a custom filter for an open
      source project you contribute to and only see notifications for that
      repository in which you are mentioned. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-notifications-from-your-inbox"
        >Managing notifications from your inbox</a

    </p>
    <h2 id="notification-retention-policy">Notification retention policy</h2>
    <p>
      Notifications that are not marked as <strong>Saved</strong> are kept for 5
      months. Notifications marked as <strong>Saved</strong> are kept
      indefinitely. If your saved notification is older than 5 months and you
      unsave it, the notification will disappear from your inbox within a day.
