    <p>
      Saved replies allow you to create a reusable response to issues and pull
      requests. Save time by creating a saved reply for the responses you use
      most frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve added a saved reply, it can be used in both issues and pull
      requests. Saved replies are tied to your user account. Once they’re
      created, you’ll be able to use them across repositories and organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create a maximum of 100 saved replies. If you’ve reached the
      maximum limit, you can delete saved replies that you no longer use or edit
      existing saved replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the {% data variables.product.product_name %}-provided
      “Duplicate issue” saved reply to mark an issue as a duplicate and track it
      with a similar issue.
