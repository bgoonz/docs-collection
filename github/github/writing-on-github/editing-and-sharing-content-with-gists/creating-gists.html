<p>Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. {% ifversion not ghae %}If you are signed in to {% data variables.product.product_name %} when{% else %}When{% endif %} you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your {% data variables.gists.gist_homepage %}.</p>
<p>Gists can be {% ifversion ghae %}internal{% else %}public{% endif %} or secret. {% ifversion ghae %}Internal{% else %}Public{% endif %} gists show up in {% data variables.gists.discover_url %}, where {% ifversion ghae %}enterprise members{% else %}people{% endif %} can browse new gists as they’re created. They’re also searchable, so you can use them if you’d like other people to find and see your work.</p>
<p>Secret gists don’t show up in {% data variables.gists.discover_url %} and are not searchable. Secret gists aren’t private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to {% ifversion ghae %}another enterprise member{% else %}a friend {% endif %}, they’ll be able to see it. However, if {% ifversion ghae %}any other enterprise member{% else %}someone you don’t know{% endif %} discovers the URL, they’ll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to <a href="/articles/creating-a-new-repository">create a private repository</a> instead.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.gist.cannot-convert-public-gists-to-secret %}</p>
<p>{% ifversion ghes %}</p>
<p>If your site administrator has disabled private mode, you can also use anonymous gists, which can be public or secret.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.gist.anonymous-gists-cannot-be-deleted %}</p>
<p>{% endif %}</p>
<p>You’ll receive a notification when: - You are the author of a gist. - Someone mentions you in a gist. - You subscribe to a gist, by clicking <strong>Subscribe</strong> at the top of any gist.</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt or ghes %}</p>
<p>You can pin gists to your profile so other people can see them easily. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile">Pinning items to your profile</a>.”</p>
<p>{% endif %}</p>
<p>You can discover {% ifversion ghae %}internal{% else %}public{% endif %} gists others have created by going to the {% data variables.gists.gist_homepage %} and clicking <strong>All Gists</strong>. This will take you to a page of all gists sorted and displayed by time of creation or update. You can also search gists by language with {% data variables.gists.gist_search_url %}. Gist search uses the same search syntax as <a href="/articles/searching-code">code search</a>.</p>
<p>Since gists are Git repositories, you can view their full commit history, complete with diffs. You can also fork or clone gists. For more information, see <a href="/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists">“Forking and cloning gists”</a>.</p>
<p>You can download a ZIP file of a gist by clicking the <strong>Download ZIP</strong> button at the top of the gist. You can embed a gist in any text field that supports Javascript, such as a blog post. To get the embed code, click the clipboard icon next to the <strong>Embed</strong> URL of a gist. To embed a specific gist file, append the <strong>Embed</strong> URL with <code>?file=FILENAME</code>.</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt %}</p>
<p>Gist supports mapping GeoJSON files. These maps are displayed in embedded gists, so you can easily share and embed maps. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github">Mapping GeoJSON files on {% data variables.product.product_name %}</a>.”</p>
<p>{% endif %}</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-gist">Creating a gist</h2>
<p>Follow the steps below to create a gist.</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghae %} {% note %}</p>
<p>You can also create a gist using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see “<a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_gist_create"><code>gh gist create</code></a>” in the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} documentation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can drag and drop a text file from your desktop directly into the editor.</p>
