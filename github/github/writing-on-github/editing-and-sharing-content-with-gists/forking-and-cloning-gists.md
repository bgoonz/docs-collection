## Forking gists

Each gist indicates which forks have activity, making it easy to find interesting changes from others.

## Cloning gists

If you want to make local changes to a gist and push them up to the web, you can clone a gist and make commits the same as you would with any Git repository. For more information, see "[Cloning a repository](/articles/cloning-a-repository)."
