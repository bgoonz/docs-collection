## Fenced code blocks

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\`\`\`</code> before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

<pre>
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
</pre>

{% tip %}

**Tip:** To preserve your formatting within a list, make sure to indent non-fenced code blocks by eight spaces.

{% endtip %}

To display triple backticks in a fenced code block, wrap them inside quadruple backticks.


<pre>
```` 
```
Look! You can see my backticks.
```
````
</pre>

## Syntax highlighting

<!-- If you make changes to this feature, update /getting-started-with-github/github-language-support to reflect any changes to supported languages. -->

You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.

For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

    ```ruby
    require 'redcarpet'
    markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
    puts markdown.to_html
    ```

We use [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) to perform language detection and to select [third-party grammars](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/vendor/README.md) for syntax highlighting. You can find out which keywords are valid in [the languages YAML file](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
