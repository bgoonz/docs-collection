To qualify for a priority response, you must:
- Submit your question to [{% data variables.contact.enterprise_support %}](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?github_product=cloud) from a verified email address that's associated with an organization currently using {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}
- Submit a new support ticket for each individual priority situation

- Understand that the response to a priority question will be received via email
- Cooperate with {% data variables.contact.github_support %} and provide all of the information that {% data variables.contact.github_support %} asks for

{% tip %}

**Tip:** Questions do not qualify for a priority response if they are submitted on a local holiday in your jurisdiction.

{% endtip %}

The target eight-hour response time:
- Begins when {% data variables.contact.github_support %} receives your qualifying question
- Does not begin until you have provided sufficient information to answer the question, unless you specifically indicate that you do not have sufficient information
- Does not apply on weekends in your local timezone or local holidays in your jurisdiction

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.contact.github_support %} does not guarantee a resolution to your priority question. {% data variables.contact.github_support %} may escalate or deescalate issues to or from priority question status, based on our reasonable evaluation of the information you give to us.
