Many files can be [renamed directly on {% data variables.product.product_name %}](/articles/renaming-a-file), but some files, such as images, require that you rename them from the command line.

3. Rename the file, specifying the old file name and the new name you'd like to give the file. This will stage your change for commit.
  ```shell
  $ git mv <em>old_filename</em> <em>new_filename</em>
  ```
4. Use `git status` to check the old and new file names.
  ```shell
  $ git status
  > # On branch <em>your-branch</em>
  > # Changes to be committed:
  > #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
  > #
  > #     renamed: <em>old_filename</em> -> <em>new_filename</em>
  > #
  ```
{% data reusables.git.commit-file %}
  ```shell
  $ git commit -m "Rename file"
  # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.
  # {% data reusables.git.reset-head-to-previous-commit-codeblock %}
  ```
{% data reusables.git.git-push %}
