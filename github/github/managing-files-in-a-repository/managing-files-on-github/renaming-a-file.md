title: Renaming a file
intro: 'You can rename any file in your repositories directly in {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Renaming a file also gives you the opportunity to [move the file to a new location](/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location).'

**Tips**:

- If you try to rename a file in a repository that you donâ€™t have access to, we will fork the project to your user account and help you send [a pull request](/articles/about-pull-requests) to the original repository after you commit your change.
- File names created via the web interface can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`). To use other characters, create and commit the files locally and then push them to the repository.
- Some files, such as images, require that you rename them from the command line. For more information, see "[Renaming a file using the command line](/articles/renaming-a-file-using-the-command-line)."

1. In your repository, browse to the file you want to rename.

3. In the filename field, change the name of the file to the new filename you want. You can also update the contents of your file at the same time.
