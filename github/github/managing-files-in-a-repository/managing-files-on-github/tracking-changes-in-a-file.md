With the blame view, you can view the line-by-line revision history for an entire file, or view the revision history of a single line within a file by clicking {% octicon "versions" aria-label="The prior blame icon" %}. Each time you click {% octicon "versions" aria-label="The prior blame icon" %}, you'll see the previous revision information for that line, including who committed the change and when.

In a file or pull request, you can also use the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab octicon" %} menu to view Git blame for a selected line or range of lines.

**Tip:** On the command line, you can also use `git blame` to view the revision history of lines within a file. For more information, see [Git's `git blame` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).
