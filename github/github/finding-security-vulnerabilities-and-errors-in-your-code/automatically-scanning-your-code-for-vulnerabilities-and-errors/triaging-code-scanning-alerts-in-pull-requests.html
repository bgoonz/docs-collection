      About {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} results on pull
      requests
    </h2>
    <p>
      In repositories where {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}
      is configured as a pull request check, {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} checks the code in the pull
      request. By default, this is limited to pull requests that target the
      default branch, but you can change this configuration within {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} or in a third-party CI/CD system. If
      merging the changes would introduce new {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts to the target branch,
      these are reported as check results in the pull request. The alerts are
      also shown as annotations in the <strong>Files changed</strong> tab of the
      pull request. If you have write permission for the repository, you can see
      any existing {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts on
      the <strong>Security</strong> tab. For information about repository
      alerts, see “<a
        href="/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository"
        >Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts for
        your repository</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} has any results
      with a severity of <code>error</code>, the check fails and the error is
      reported in the check results. If all the results found by {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} have lower severities, the
      alerts are treated as warnings or notices and the check succeeds. If your
      pull request targets a protected branch that uses {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}, and the repository owner has
      configured required status checks, then you must either fix or close all
      error alerts before the pull request can be merged. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging"
        >About protected branches</a

      request check
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many options for configuring {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} as a pull request check, so
      the exact setup of each repository will vary and some will have more than
      one check. The check that contains the results of {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is:
      <strong>Code scanning results</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the repository uses the {% data
      variables.product.prodname_codeql_workflow %} a
      <strong
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} / Analyze
        (LANGUAGE)</strong
      >
      check is run for each language before the results check runs. The analysis
      check may fail if there are configuration problems, or if the pull request
      breaks the build for a language that the analysis needs to compile (for
      example, C/C++, C#, or Java). As with other pull request checks, you can
      see full details of the check failure on the <strong>Checks</strong> tab.
      For more information about configuring and troubleshooting, see “<a
        href="/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-code-scanning"

    <h2 id="triaging-an-alert-on-your-pull-request">
      Triaging an alert on your pull request
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you look at the <strong>Files changed</strong> tab for a pull
      request, you see annotations for any lines of code that triggered the
      alert.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-pr-annotation.png"
        alt="Alert annotation within a pull request diff"
      />
      <figcaption>Alert annotation within a pull request diff</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If you have write permission for the repository, some annotations contain
      links with extra context for the alert. In the example above, from {% data
      variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis, you can click
      <strong>user-provided value</strong> to see where the untrusted data
      enters the data flow (this is referred to as the source). In this case you
      can also view the full path from the source to the code that uses the data
      (the sink) by clicking <strong>Show paths</strong>. This makes it easy to
      check whether the data is untrusted or if the analysis failed to recognize
      a data sanitization step between the source and the sink. For information
      about analyzing data flow using {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql
      %}, see “<a
        href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/about-data-flow-analysis/"
        >About data flow analysis</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To see more information about an alert, users with write permission can
      click the <strong>Show more details</strong> link shown in the annotation.
      This allows you to see all of the context and metadata provided by the
      tool in an alert view. In the example below, you can see tags showing the
      severity, type, and relevant common weakness enumerations (CWEs) for the
      problem. The view also shows which commit introduced the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the detailed view for an alert, some {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} tools, like {% data
      variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis, also include a description
      of the problem and a <strong>Show more</strong> link for guidance on how
      to fix your code.

      Resolving an alert on your pull request
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anyone with push access to a pull request can fix a {% data
      variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alert that’s identified on
      that pull request. If you commit changes to the pull request this triggers
      a new run of the pull request checks. If your changes fix the problem, the
      alert is closed and the annotation removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t think that an alert needs to be fixed, users with write
      permission can close the alert manually. {% data
      reusables.code-scanning.close-alert-examples %} The
      <strong>Close</strong> button is available in annotations and in the
      alerts view if you have write permission for the repository.
