      GitHub Importer looks for GitHub users whose email addresses match the
      authors of the commits in the repository you’re importing. You can then
      connect a commit to its author using their email address or the author’s
      GitHub username.

        After you’ve imported your repository, on the import status page, click
        <strong>Match authors</strong>.

      Attributing commits to a GitHub user with a public email address
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the author of a commit in your imported repository has a GitHub account
      associated with the email address they used to author the commits, and
      they haven’t
      <a href="/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address"
        >set their commit email address as private</a
      >, GitHub Importer will match the email address associated with the commit
      to the public email address associated with their GitHub account, and
      attribute the commit to their GitHub account.
    </p>
    <h2
      id="attributing-commits-to-a-github-user-without-a-public-email-address"
    >
      Attributing commits to a GitHub user without a public email address
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the author of a commit in your imported repository has neither set a
      public email address on their GitHub profile, nor
      <a href="/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address"
        >set their commit email address as private</a
      >, GitHub Importer may not be able to match the email address associated
      with the commit with their GitHub account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commit author can resolve this by setting their email address as
      private. Their commits will then be attributed to
      <code>&lt;username&gt;@users.noreply.github.com</code>, and the imported
      commits will be associated with their GitHub account.
    </p>

      Attributing commits using an email address

    <p>
      If the author’s email address is not associated with their GitHub account,
      they can
      <a href="/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account"
        >add the address to their account</a
      >
      after the import, and the commits will be correctly attributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the author does not have a GitHub account, GitHub Importer will
      attribute their commits to the email address associated with the commits.
