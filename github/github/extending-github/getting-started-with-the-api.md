To automate common tasks, back up your data, or create integrations that extend {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can use the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API.

For more information about the API, see the [GitHub REST API](/rest) and [GitHub GraphQL API](/graphql). You can also stay current with API-related news by following the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Developer blog](https://developer.github.com/changes/).
