      {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} is available for every

      Tracking storage and bandwidth use
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you commit and push a change to a file tracked with {% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, a new version of the entire
      file is pushed and the total file size is counted against the repository
      owner’s storage limit. When you download a file tracked with {% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, the total file size is
      counted against the repository owner’s bandwidth limit. {% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_short %} uploads do not count against
      the bandwidth limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: - If you push a 500 MB file to {% data
      variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, you’ll use 500 MB of your
      allotted storage and none of your bandwidth. If you make a 1 byte change
      and push the file again, you’ll use another 500 MB of storage and no
      bandwidth, bringing your total usage for these two pushes to 1 GB of
      storage and zero bandwidth. - If you download a 500 MB file that’s tracked
      with LFS, you’ll use 500 MB of the repository owner’s allotted bandwidth.
      If a collaborator pushes a change to the file and you pull the new version
      to your local repository, you’ll use another 500 MB of bandwidth, bringing
      the total usage for these two downloads to 1 GB of bandwidth.

      If you use more than {% data variables.large_files.initial_storage_quota
      %} of storage without purchasing a data pack, you can still clone
      repositories with large assets, but you will only retrieve the pointer
      files, and you will not be able to push new files back up. For more
      information about pointer files, see “<a

      If you use more than {% data variables.large_files.initial_bandwidth_quota

      variables.large_files.product_name_short %} support is disabled on your
      account until the next month.
