## Removing a single file

1.  Remove the file from the repository's Git history using either the `filter-branch` command or BFG Repo-Cleaner. For detailed information on using these, see "[Removing sensitive data from a repository](/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)."
2. Navigate to your *.gitattributes* file.

  {% note %}

  **Note:** Your *.gitattributes* file is generally saved within your local repository. In some cases, you may have created a global *.gitattributes* file that contains all of your {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} associations.

  {% endnote %}
3. Find and remove the associated {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} tracking rule within the *.gitattributes* file.
4. Save and exit the *.gitattributes* file.

## Removing all files within a {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} repository

2. Optionally, to uninstall {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} in the repository, run:

## {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in your repository

After you remove files from {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, the {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects still exist on the remote storage{% ifversion fpt %} and will continue to count toward your {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} storage quota{% endif %}.

To remove {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects from a repository, {% ifversion fpt %}delete and recreate the repository. When you delete a repository, any associated issues, stars, and forks are also deleted. For more information, see "[Deleting a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-a-repository)." If you need to purge a removed object and you are unable to delete the repository, please [contact support](/github/working-with-github-support) for help.{% else %}contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} administrator to archive the objects. Archived objects are purged after three months.{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note:** If you removed a single file and have other {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects that you'd like to keep in your repository, after deleting and recreating your repository, reconfigure your {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}-associated files. For more information, see "[Removing a single file](#removing-a-single-file)" and "[Configuring {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}](/github/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage)."
