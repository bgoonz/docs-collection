      File and repository size limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
      To ensure performance and reliability for our users, we actively monitor
      signals of overall repository health. Repository health is a function of
      various interacting factors, including size, commit frequency, contents,
      and structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend repositories remain small, ideally less than 1 GB, and less
      than 5 GB is strongly recommended. Smaller repositories are faster to
      clone and easier to work with and maintain. Individual files in a
      repository are strictly limited to a {% data
      variables.large_files.max_github_size %} maximum size limit. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files"
        >Working with large files</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If your repository excessively impacts our infrastructure, you might
      receive an email from {% data variables.contact.github_support %} asking
      you to take corrective action. We try to be flexible, especially with
      large projects that have many collaborators, and will work with you to
      find a resolution whenever possible. You can prevent your repository from
      impacting our infrastructure by effectively managing your repository’s
      size and overall health. You can find advice and a tool for repository
      analysis in the
      <a href="https://github.com/github/git-sizer"
        ><code>github/git-sizer</code></a
      >
      repository.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you add a file to a repository via a browser,
      the file can be no larger than {% data
      variables.large_files.max_github_browser_size %}. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository"

    <h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
    <p>
      Git is not designed to serve as a backup tool. However, there are many
      solutions specifically designed for performing backups, such as
      <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com/">Arq</a>,
      <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/">Carbonite</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/">CrashPlan</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="database-dumps">Database dumps</h2>
    <p>
      Version control systems, such as Git, are not designed to handle large SQL
      files. To share large databases with other developers, we recommend using
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git shouldn’t be used to backup your production servers. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota#backups"
        >Backups</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="external-dependencies">External dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      External dependencies can cause Git repositories to become very large. To
      avoid filling a repository with external dependencies, we recommend you
      use a package manager. Popular package managers for common languages
      include <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>,
      <a href="http://npmjs.org/">Node’s Package Manager</a>, and
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. These package managers
      support using Git repositories directly, so you don’t need pre-packaged
      sources.
    </p>
    <h2 id="packaged-release-versions">Packaged release versions</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t recommend distributing compiled code and pre-packaged releases
      within your repository. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-large-files/distributing-large-binaries"
        >Distributing large binaries</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="changing-history-of-an-existing-repository">
      Changing history of an existing repository
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you already have a repository that’s quite large, you can reduce the
      size of a repository by removing large files from the repository’s
      history. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-large-files/removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history"
        >Removing files from a repository’s history</a
      >.”
