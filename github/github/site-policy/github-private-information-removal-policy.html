      We offer this private information removal process as an exceptional
      service only for high-risk content that violates
      <a
        href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#3-conduct-restrictions"
        >GitHub’s Terms of Service</a
      >, such as when your security is at risk from exposed access credentials.
      This guide describes the information GitHub needs from you in order to
      process a request to remove private information from a repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-private-information">What is Private Information?</h2>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this document, “private information” refers to content
      that (i) should have been kept confidential, <em>and</em> (ii) whose
      public availability poses a specific or targeted security risk to you or
      your organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Security risk” refers to a situation involving exposure to physical
      danger, identity theft, or increased likelihood of unauthorized access to
      physical or network facilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="private-information-removal-requests-are-appropriate-for">
      Private information removal requests are appropriate for:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Access credentials, such as user names combined with passwords, access
        tokens, or other sensitive secrets that can grant access to your
        organization’s server, network, or domain.
      </li>
      <li>
        AWS tokens and other similar access credentials that grant access to a
        third party on your behalf. You must be able to show that the token does
        belong to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Documentation (such as network diagrams or architecture) that poses a
        specific security risk for an organization.

        related to, and posing a security risk to, you as an individual (such as
        social security numbers or other government identification numbers).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="private-information-removal-requests-are-not-appropriate-for">
      Private information removal requests are <em>not</em> appropriate for:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Internal server names, IP addresses, and URLs, on their own. You must be
        able to show that their use in a particular file or piece of code poses
        a security threat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mere mentions of your company’s identity, name, brand, domain name, or
        other references to your company in files on GitHub. You must be able to
        articulate why a use of your company’s identity is a threat to your
        company’s security posture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Entire files or repositories that do not pose a specific security risk,
        but you believe are otherwise objectionable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Requests to remove content that may infringe your or your organization’s
        copyright rights. If you have questions about how GitHub handles
        copyright-related matters or would like to report potentially infringing
        content, please review our
        <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/">DMCA Takedown Policy</a>. The
        private information removal process is generally not intended for the
        removal of full files or repositories — only for the specific pieces of
        private information in those files. While there may be cases where files
        are filled entirely with private information, you must justify the
        security risk for the removal of such files, and this may increase the
        time required to process your request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trademark disputes. If you have questions about how GitHub handles
        trademark-related matters or would like to report content containing
        your organization’s trade or service marks, please review our
        <a href="/articles/github-trademark-policy/">Trademark Policy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Privacy complaints. If you wish to access, transfer, change, or delete
        your personal information on GitHub, please contact us via
        <a href="https://github.com/contact/privacy">our Privacy contact form</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Content governed by our
        <a href="/articles/github-community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a
        >, such as malware or general-purpose tools. If you have questions about
        our Community Guidelines or believe that content on GitHub might violate
        our guidelines, you can use {% data variables.contact.report_content %}
        to contact us.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="things-to-know">Things to Know</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ask Nicely First.</strong> A great first step before sending us a
      request to remove data is to try contacting the user directly. They may
      have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the
      repository’s README or Support file, or you could get in touch by creating
      an issue or pull request in the repository. This is not strictly required,
      but it is appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No Bots.</strong> You should have a trained professional evaluate
      the facts of every request you send. If you’re outsourcing your efforts to
      a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are
      not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints
      often include data that does not pose any security threats, and they do
      not include sufficient explanations, requiring additional back-and-forth
      and resulting in delays, even when the complaint is valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Send In The Correct Request.</strong> As noted above, we offer
      this private information removal process as an exceptional service only
      for high-risk content. We are not able to use this process to remove other
      kinds of content, such as potentially infringing content, and we are not
      able to process any other kinds of removal requests simultaneously while
      processing private information removal requests. We will be able to help
      you more quickly if you send in your private information removal requests
      separately from any requests to remove potentially infringing content. If
      you are unsure whether your request involves only private information or
      also involves other legal matters, please consult legal counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Processing Time.</strong> While we do process private information
      removal requests as quickly as possible, due to the volume of requests we
      process, it may take some time for your request to be reviewed. Additional
      requests, or multiple requests from additional points of contact, may
      result in delays.

          <a href="#your-request-must-include">details we require</a> — most
          importantly, an explanation of how the data poses a security risk.
          GitHub is not in a position to search for or make initial
          determinations about private information on any individual’s or
          organization’s behalf.

          the request or to dispute the claim.

          repository. If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will

    <h3 id="what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">
      What About Forks? (or What’s a Fork?)
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to “fork” one
      another’s repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that
      users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories.
      As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork
      to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own
      variation of a project. Each of these copies is a “<a
        href="/articles/github-glossary/#fork"
        >fork</a
      >” of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the
      “parent” of the fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent
      repository. This is because forks belong to different users and may have
      been altered in significant ways. GitHub does not conduct any independent
      investigation into forks. We expect those sending private information
      removal requests to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that
      the forks also contain private information, expressly include forks in
      their request.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing
      forks of that repository, we would process a valid claim against all forks
      in that network at the time we process the notice. We would do this given
      the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same
      content. In addition, if the reported network that contains the reported
      content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be
      difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire
      network if you state in your notice that, based on the representative
      number of forks you have reviewed, you believe that all or most of the
      forks contain the content reported in the parent repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sending-a-private-information-removal-request">
      Sending A Private Information Removal Request
    </h2>
    <p>
      Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way
      that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific
      as possible. In order for us to verify that a user has removed reported
      private information completely, we need to know exactly where to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      These guidelines are designed to make the processing of requests to remove
      private information as straightforward as possible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="your-request-must-include">Your Request Must Include:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        A working, clickable link to each file containing private information.
        (Note that we’re not able to work from search results, examples, or
        screenshots.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific line numbers within each file containing the private
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        A brief description of how each item you’ve identified poses a security
        risk to you or your organization.

        If you are a third party acting as an agent for an organization facing a

      </li>
      <li>
        OPTIONAL: Let us know if your request is particularly urgent, and why.
        We respond to all private information removal requests as quickly as
        possible. However, if this request is especially time-sensitive, such as
        a very recent credential exposure, please explain why.
