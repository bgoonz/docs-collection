<h1 class="title">GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features</h1>
</header>
<p>Version Effective Date: May 26, 2021</p>
<p>When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features (“Additional Products and Features”). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, specific terms for that product or feature may apply in addition to your main agreement with us—the GitHub Terms of Service, GitHub Corporate Terms of Service, GitHub General Terms, or Microsoft volume licensing agreement (each, the “Agreement”). Below, we’ve listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.</p>
<p>By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub terms for Additional Product and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>For Enterprise users</strong> - <strong>GitHub Enterprise Cloud</strong> users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, Learning Lab, Octoshift, Packages and Pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Enterprise Server</strong> users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, Learning Lab, Octoshift, Packages, Pages and SQL Server Images.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub AE</strong> users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, {% ifversion ghae-next %}Connect, {% endif %}Dependabot Preview, Octoshift, Packages and Pages.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The <a href="/actions">Actions documentation</a> includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits.</p>
<p>Actions and any elements of the Actions service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the <a href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies">GitHub Acceptable Use Polices</a>, or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the <a href="/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration">Actions documentation</a>. Additionally, Actions should not be used for: - cryptomining; - using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the <a href="https://bounty.github.com">GitHub Bug Bounty program</a>); - the provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Actions or any elements of Actions for commercial purposes; - any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don’t use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or - any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.</p>
<p>In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, or the disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-security">Advanced Security</h2>

<p>Advanced Security is licensed on a “Unique Committer” basis. A “Unique Committer” is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or GitHub AE, who has made a code commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions.</p>
