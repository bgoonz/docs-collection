    </h2>
    <p>
      You may use information from our Service for the following reasons,

      API, or obtained otherwise:
    </p>
    <ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Scraping refers to extracting information from our Service via an
      automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. Scraping does not refer to
      the collection of information through our API. Please see Section H of our
      <a href="/articles/github-terms-of-service#h-api-terms"
        >Terms of Service</a

      for our API Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not use information from the Service (whether scraped, collected
      through our API, or obtained otherwise) for spamming purposes, including
      for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling User
      Personal Information (as defined in the
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement"
        >GitHub Privacy Statement</a
      >), such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

    <p>
      Your use of information from the Service must comply with the
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement"
        >GitHub Privacy Statement</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="privacy">7. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Misuse of User Personal Information is prohibited.</p>
    <p>
      Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must
      comply with the
      <a href="/articles/github-privacy-statement">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>,
      particularly in regards to the collection of User Personal Information. If
      you collect any User Personal Information from the Service, you agree that
      you will only use that User Personal Information for the purpose for which
      that User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any
      User Personal Information you have gathered from the Service, and you will
      respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact”
      requests from us or other users.

    <h2 id="excessive-bandwidth-use">8. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Service’s bandwidth limitations vary based on the features you use. If
      we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in
      relation to other users of similar features, we reserve the right to
      suspend your Account, throttle your file hosting, or otherwise limit your
      activity until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption. We also reserve
      the right—after providing advance notice—to delete repositories that we
      determine to be placing undue strain on our infrastructure. For guidance
      on acceptable use of object storage in repositories, refer to “<a
        href="/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota"
        >What is my disk quota?</a

    <h2 id="advertising-on-github">9. Advertising on GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Short version:</strong>
      <em
        >We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we
        expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not
        become a spam haven. No one wants that.</em

    </p>
    <p>
      While we understand that you may want to promote your Content by posting
      supporters’ names or logos in your Account, the primary focus of the
      Content posted in or through your Account to the Service should not be
      advertising or promotional marketing. This includes Content posted in or
      through Pages, Packages, repositories, and all other parts of the Service.
      You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README
      documents or project description sections associated with your Account,
      but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may
      not advertise in other Users’ Accounts, such as by posting monetized or
      excessive bulk content in issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not promote or distribute content or activity that is illegal or
      otherwise prohibited by our
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a
      >,
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines/"

      >, or
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies/"
        >Acceptable Use Policy</a
      >, including excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming),
      get-rich-quick schemes, and misrepresentation or deception related to your
      promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide to post any promotional materials in your Account, you are
      solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations,
      including without limitation the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s
      Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials. We reserve the right to
      remove any promotional materials or advertisements that, in our sole
      discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub reserves the right to remove any Content in violation of this
      policy.

    <h2 id="user-protection">10. User Protection</h2>
