Version Effective Date: May 26, 2021

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, specific terms for that product or feature may apply in addition to your main agreement with us—the GitHub Terms of Service, GitHub Corporate Terms of Service, GitHub General Terms, or Microsoft volume licensing agreement (each, the "Agreement"). Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub terms for Additional Product and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

**For Enterprise users**
- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, Learning Lab, Octoshift, Packages and Pages. 

- **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, Learning Lab, Octoshift, Packages, Pages and SQL Server Images. 

- **GitHub AE** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, {% ifversion ghae-next %}Connect, {% endif %}Dependabot Preview, Octoshift, Packages and Pages.

## Actions
GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The [Actions documentation](/actions) includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits. 

Actions and any elements of the Actions service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the [GitHub Acceptable Use Polices](/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the [Actions documentation](/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration). Additionally, Actions should not be used for:
- cryptomining;
- using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com));
- the provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Actions or any elements of Actions for commercial purposes;
- any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or
- any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, or the disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms.


## Advanced Security
GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license. These features include code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The [Advanced Security documentation](/github/getting-started-with-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides more details.

Advanced Security is licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or GitHub AE, who has made a code commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions. 

## Advisory Database
The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub.

_License Grant to Us_

We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## npm
npm is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. npm is the registry of record for the JavaScript ecosystem. The npm public registry is free to use but customers are billed if they want to publish private packages or manage private packages using teams. The [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) includes details about the limitation of account types and how to manage [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages) and [organizations](https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations). Acceptable use of the npm registry is outlined in the [open-source terms](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms). There are supplementary terms for both the npm [solo](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan) and [org](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/orgs-plan) plans. The npm [Terms of Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms) apply to your use of npm.

## Octoshift
Octoshift is a framework for exporting data from other sources to be imported to the GitHub platform. Octoshift is provided “AS-IS”.

## Packages
GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. GitHub Packages is billed on a usage basis. The [Packages documentation](/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages) includes details, including bandwidth and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Packages usage and set usage limits. Packages bandwidth usage is limited by the [GitHub Acceptable Use Polices](/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies).

## Pages

Each Account comes with access to the [GitHub Pages static hosting service](/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). GitHub Pages is intended to host static web pages, but primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. 

GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links. 

### a. Bandwidth and Usage Limits
