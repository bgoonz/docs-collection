    <p>
      Millions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and
      closed source — and we’re honored to play a part in enabling collaboration
      across the community every day. Together, we all have an exciting
      opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be proud
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and
      experiences, and range from people who created their first “Hello World”
      project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world.
      We are committed to making GitHub a welcoming environment for all the
      different voices and perspectives in our community, while maintaining a
      space where people are free to express themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on our community members to communicate expectations,
      <a href="#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you">moderate</a> their
      projects, and {% data variables.contact.report_abuse %} or {% data
      variables.contact.report_content %}. By outlining what we expect to see
      within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to
      collaborate on GitHub, and what type of actions or content may violate our
      <a href="#legal-notices">Terms of Service</a>, which include our
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies"
        >Acceptable Use Policies</a
      >. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content
      on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <h2 id="building-a-strong-community">Building a strong community</h2>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software
      projects. We want people to work better together. Although we maintain the
      site, this is a community we build <em>together</em>, and we need your
      help to make it the best it can be.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Be welcoming and open-minded</strong> - Other collaborators
          may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that
          doesn’t mean they don’t have good ideas to contribute. We encourage
          you to be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting
          started.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Respect each other.</strong> Nothing sabotages healthy
          conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don’t post
          anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive,
          or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with
          dignity and consideration in all interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s
          fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid name-calling,
          ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual
          content, and knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned
          counter-arguments that improve the conversation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with empathy</strong> - Disagreements or
          differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community
          means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and
          perspectives, many of which may not be your own. If you disagree with
          someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address
          them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where
          people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in
          discussions, and making contributions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Be clear and stay on topic</strong> - People use GitHub to get
          work done and to be more productive. Off-topic comments are a
          distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work
          done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and
          productive discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, communicating with strangers on the Internet can be
          awkward. It’s hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently
          misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will
          be received by the other person.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you">
      What if something or someone offends you?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We rely on the community to let us know when an issue needs to be
      addressed. We do not actively monitor the site for offensive content. If
      you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable,
      here are some tools GitHub provides to help you take action immediately:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate expectations</strong> - If you participate in a
          community that has not set their own, community-specific guidelines,
          encourage them to do so either in the README or
          <a href="/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/"
            >CONTRIBUTING file</a
          >, or in
          <a href="/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/"
            >a dedicated code of conduct</a
          >, by submitting a pull request.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Moderate Comments</strong> - If you have
          <a href="/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/"
            >write-access privileges</a
          >
          for a repository, you can edit, delete, or hide anyone’s comments on
          commits, pull requests, and issues. Anyone with read access to a
          repository can view a comment’s edit history. Comment authors and
          people with write access to a repository can delete sensitive
          information from a comment’s edit history. For more information, see
          “<a href="/articles/tracking-changes-in-a-comment"
            >Tracking changes in a comment</a
          >” and “<a href="/articles/managing-disruptive-comments"
            >Managing disruptive comments</a
          >.”
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Lock Conversations</strong>  - If a discussion in an issue or
          pull request gets out of control, you can
          <a href="/articles/locking-conversations/">lock the conversation</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Block Users</strong>  - If you encounter a user who continues
          to demonstrate poor behavior, you can
          <a href="/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account/"
            >block the user from your personal account</a
          >
          or
          <a href="/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization/"
            >block the user from your organization</a
          >.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, you can always contact us to {% data
      variables.contact.report_abuse %} if you need more help dealing with a
      situation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-not-allowed">What is not allowed?</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to
      express themselves and challenge one another’s ideas, both technical and
      otherwise. Such discussions, however, are unlikely to foster fruitful
      dialog when ideas are silenced because community members are being shouted
      down or are afraid to speak up. That means you should be respectful and
      civil at all times, and refrain from attacking others on the basis of who
      they are. We do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4 id="threats-of-violence">Threats of violence</h4>
        <p>
          You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to
          organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism.
          Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even
          the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others.
          Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that
          way. If you think that someone else <em>might</em> interpret the
          content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism,
          stop. Don’t post it on GitHub. In extraordinary cases, we may report
          threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a
          genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="hate-speech-and-discrimination">
          Hate speech and discrimination
        </h4>
        <p>
          While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size,
          disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
          experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
          sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that
          attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just
          realize that when approached in an aggressive or insulting manner,
          these (and other) sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or
          perhaps even unsafe. While there’s always the potential for
          misunderstandings, we expect our community members to remain
          respectful and civil when discussing sensitive topics.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="bullying-and-harassment">Bullying and harassment</h4>
        <p>
          We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual
          badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of
          people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to
          engage in them, there’s a good chance you are headed into bullying or
          harassment territory.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="disrupting-the-experience-of-other-users">
          Disrupting the experience of other users
        </h4>
        <p>
          Being part of a community includes recognizing how your behavior
          affects others and engaging in meaningful and productive interactions
          with people and the platform they rely on. Behaviors such as
          repeatedly posting off-topic comments, opening empty or meaningless
          issues or pull requests, or using any other platform feature in a way
          that continually disrupts the experience of other users are not
          allowed. While we encourage maintainers to moderate their own projects
          on an individual basis, GitHub staff may take further restrictive
          action against accounts that are engaging in these types of behaviors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h4>
        <p>
          You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar,
          posting content under their email address, using a similar username or
          otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of
          harassment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="doxxing-and-invasion-of-privacy">
          Doxxing and invasion of privacy
        </h4>
        <p>
          Don’t post other people’s personal information, such as personal,
          private email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, credit
          card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords.
          Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or
          harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or
          videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent,
          to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a
          safety risk to the subject.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="sexually-obscene-content">Sexually obscene content</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t post content that is pornographic. This does not mean that all
          nudity, or all code and content related to sexuality, is prohibited.
          We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic
          sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for
          educational or artistic purposes. We do not allow obscene sexual
          content or content that may involve the exploitation or sexualization
          of minors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="gratuitously-violent-content">Gratuitously violent content</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t post violent images, text, or other content without reasonable
          context or warnings. While it’s often okay to include violent content
          in video games, news reports, and descriptions of historical events,
          we do not allow violent content that is posted indiscriminately, or
          that is posted in a way that makes it difficult for other users to
          avoid (such as a profile avatar or an issue comment). A clear warning
          or disclaimer in other contexts helps users make an educated decision
          as to whether or not they want to engage with such content.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="misinformation-and-disinformation">
          Misinformation and disinformation
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may not post content that presents a distorted view of reality,
          whether it is inaccurate or false (misinformation) or is intentionally
          deceptive (disinformation) where such content is likely to result in
          harm to the public or to interfere with fair and equal opportunities
          for all to participate in public life. For example, we do not allow
          content that may put the well-being of groups of people at risk or
          limit their ability to take part in a free and open society. We
          encourage active participation in the expression of ideas,
          perspectives, and experiences and may not be in a position to dispute
          personal accounts or observations. We generally allow parody and
          satire that is in line with our Acceptable Use Polices, and we
          consider context to be important in how information is received and
          understood; therefore, it may be appropriate to clarify your
          intentions via disclaimers or other means, as well as the source(s) of
          your information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 id="active-malware-or-exploits">Active malware or exploits</h4>
        <p>
          Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other
          members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform
          in direct support of unlawful attacks that cause technical harms, such
          as using GitHub as a means to deliver malicious executables or as
          attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service
          attacks or managing command and control servers. Technical harms means
          overconsumption of resources, physical damage, downtime, denial of
          service, or data loss, with no implicit or explicit dual-use purpose
          prior to the abuse occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that GitHub allows dual-use content and supports the posting of
          content that is used for research into vulnerabilities, malware, or
          exploits, as the publication and distribution of such content has
          educational value and provides a net benefit to the security
          community. We assume positive intention and use of these projects to
          promote and drive improvements across the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In rare cases of very widespread abuse of dual-use content, we may
          restrict access to that specific instance of the content to disrupt an
          ongoing unlawful attack or malware campaign that is leveraging the
          GitHub platform as an exploit or malware CDN. In most of these
          instances, restriction takes the form of putting the content behind
          authentication, but may, as an option of last resort, involve
          disabling access or full removal where this is not possible (e.g. when
          posted as a gist). We will also contact the project owners about
          restrictions put in place where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restrictions are temporary where feasible, and do not serve the
          purpose of purging or restricting any specific dual-use content, or
          copies of that content, from the platform in perpetuity. While we aim
          to make these rare cases of restriction a collaborative process with
          project owners, if you do feel your content was unduly restricted, we
          have an <a href="#appeal-and-reinstatement">appeals process</a> in
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          To facilitate a path to abuse resolution with project maintainers
          themselves, prior to escalation to GitHub abuse reports, we recommend,
          but do not require, that repository owners take the following steps
          when posting potentially harmful security research content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clearly identify and describe any potentially harmful content in a
            disclaimer in the project’s README.md file or source code comments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a preferred contact method for any 3rd party abuse inquiries
            through a SECURITY.md file in the repository (e.g. “Please create an
            issue on this repository for any questions or concerns”). Such a
            contact method allows 3rd parties to reach out to project
            maintainers directly and potentially resolve concerns without the
            need to file abuse reports.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >GitHub considers the npm registry to be a platform used primarily
            for installation and run-time use of code, and not for research.</em

    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-happens-if-someone-breaks-the-rules">
      What happens if someone breaks the rules?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are a variety of actions that we may take when a user reports
      inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact
      circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may
      say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did
      not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let
      their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks
      who just want to spam or cause trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response
      to meet the needs of the situation that has been reported. We’ll review
      each abuse report on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a
      diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as
      appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions we may take in response to an abuse report include but are not
      limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Content Removal</li>
      <li>Content Blocking</li>
      <li>Account Suspension</li>
      <li>Account Termination</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="appeal-and-reinstatement">Appeal and Reinstatement</h2>
    <p>
      In some cases there may be a basis to reverse an action, for example,
      based on additional information a user provided, or where a user has
      addressed the violation and agreed to abide by our Acceptable Use Policies
      moving forward. If you wish to appeal an enforcement action, please
      contact <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">support</a>.
