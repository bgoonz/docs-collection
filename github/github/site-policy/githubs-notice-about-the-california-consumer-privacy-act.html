      GitHub’s Notice to California Residents
    </h2>
    <p>
      The

        href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375"
        >California Consumer Privacy Act</a
      >
      of 2018, (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., as amended, “CCPA”) gives
      California residents rights and control over their personal information.
      GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”) provides this statement to those residents
      (“you”) in accordance with requirements under the CCPA to make certain
      disclosures about the collection and processing of their personal
      information. This is GitHub’s California-specific description of
      consumers’ privacy rights under the CCPA. For information about how we’ve
      extended the CCPA core rights to control personal information to all of
      our users in the United States, please see our
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement"
        >Privacy Statement</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="we-do-not-sell-your-personal-information">
      We do not sell your personal information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents’ personal
      information to others: 1) must give notice to California residents before
      selling their personal information to others; and 2) must provide the
      right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub <em>does not</em> sell personal information, including personal
      information of anyone under 16 years old. Thus, these notification and
      opt-out requirements do not apply to GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="your-rights-under-the-ccpa">Your rights under the CCPA</h2>
    <p>
      The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to
      their personal information. To submit a request based on these rights,
      please contact us via our
      <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">contact form</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the
      request is the resident to whom the personal information subject to the
      request pertains. California residents may exercise their rights
      themselves or may use an authorized agent to make requests to disclose
      certain information about the processing of their personal information or
      to delete personal information on their behalf. If you use an authorized
      agent to submit a request, we may require that you provide us additional
      information demonstrating that the agent is acting on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to their personal information, California residents may
      exercise the rights described below.
    </p>
    <h2
      id="right-to-know-what-personal-information-is-being-collected-for-what-purposes-and-with-whom-it-is-shared"
    >
      1. Right to know what personal information is being collected, for what
      purposes and with whom it is shared
    </h2>
    <p>
      California residents have the right to request from a business disclosure
      of the categories and specific pieces of personal information it has
      collected from them in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources
      from which such personal information is collected, the business or
      commercial purpose for collecting or selling such personal information,
      and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you request that a business disclose categories and specific pieces of
      personal information collected about you, you have the right to receive
      that information, free of charge, twice a year. The information may be
      delivered by mail or electronically and, if provided electronically, shall
      be in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable
      format that allows the California resident to relatively easily transmit
      this information to another entity. You can use GitHub’s
      <a href="/rest/reference/migrations#users">User Migration API</a> to
      access and download your data. Learn more
      <a href="https://github.blog/2018-12-19-download-your-data/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2
      id="right-to-know-whether-your-personal-information-is-sold-or-disclosed-for-a-business-purpose-and-to-whom"
    >
      2. Right to know whether your personal information is sold or disclosed
      for a business purpose and to whom
    </h2>
    <p>
      California residents have the right to request from a business that sells
      or discloses personal information for a business purpose separate lists of
      the categories of personal information collected, sold or disclosed for a
      business purpose in the preceding 12 months, including the categories of
      third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a
      business purpose.
    </p>
    <h2 id="right-to-say-no-to-the-sale-of-your-personal-information">
      3. Right to say no to the sale of your personal information
    </h2>
    <p>
      As explained above, the CCPA requires businesses that sell personal
      information to allow residents the ability to opt out of the selling of
      their information.
    </p>
    <p>Again, GitHub does not sell personal information.</p>
    <h2
      id="right-to-non-discrimination-of-service-or-price-if-you-exercise-your-privacy-rights"
    >
      4. Right to non-discrimination of service or price if you exercise your
      privacy rights
    </h2>
    <p>
      The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against a California
      resident for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA, including by -
      denying goods or services - charging different prices or rates for goods
      or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or
      by imposing penalties - providing a different level or quality of goods or
      services - suggesting that the person exercising their rights will receive
      a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
      quality of goods or services
    </p>
    <h2 id="right-to-deletion">5. Right to deletion</h2>
    <p>
      California residents have the right to request that a business delete any
      of their personal information that the business collected from them,
      subject to the exceptions in CCPA §1798.105.
