    </header>
    <p>
      GitHub events are community events intended for networking and
      collaboration in the tech community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have
      an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are
      expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all
      events hosted in the GitHub space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors,
      organizers, and volunteers at any event in the GitHub space are required
      to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this
      code throughout the event.
    </p>
    <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free event
      experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and
      expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body
      size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We
      do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we
      tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event
      participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their
      physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate
      for a professional audience including people of many different
      backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other participants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unacceptable behavior includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The use of sexualized language or imagery, or inappropriate physical
        contact, sexual attention, or advances
      </li>
      <li>
        Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political
        attacks, or sustained disruption of talks or other events
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing photography
        or recording
      </li>
      <li>Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner</li>
      <li>
        Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
        professional setting
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
      professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
      exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this event.
    </p>
    <p>Each event guest is entirely responsible for their own actions.</p>
    <p>
      Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.
