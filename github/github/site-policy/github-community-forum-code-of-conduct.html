    <h2 id="overview-and-purpose">Overview and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Millions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and
      closed source — and we’re honored to play a part in enabling collaboration
      across the developer community every day. Together, we all have an
      exciting opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be
      proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GitHub Community Forum is intended to be a place for further
      collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for
      connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and
      ideas, and finding all the support you need for your GitHub projects. By
      participating in this Community, you are agreeing to the same
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service/"
        >Terms of Service</a
      >
      and
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies"
        >GitHub Acceptable Use Policies</a
      >
      that apply to GitHub.com, as well as this Community-specific Code of
      Conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to
      collaborate in the GitHub Community Forum, what you can expect from
      moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or
      permanent suspension from Community participation. We will investigate any
      abuse reports and may moderate public content within the Community that we
      determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this
      Code of Conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and
      experiences, and range from people who created their first “Hello World”
      project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world.
      We are committed to making GitHub and the GitHub Community Forum a
      welcoming environment for all the different voices and perspectives here,
      while maintaining a space where people are free to express themselves.
    </p>
    <h2 id="pledge">Pledge</h2>
    <p>
      In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
      contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the GitHub
      Community Forum a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
      age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
      level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
      sexual identity and orientation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Treat the GitHub Community Forum with respect. We are a shared resource —
      a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human
      judgment of our Community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean,
      well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

      <em>Best Practices for Building a Strong Community</em>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be respectful and considerate.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Be welcoming and open-minded.</strong> Other Community
            members may not have the same experience level or background as you,
            but that doesn’t mean they don’t have good ideas to contribute. We
            encourage you to be welcoming to new members and those just getting
            started.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Respect each other.</strong> Nothing sabotages healthy
              conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don’t
              post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive,
              abusive, or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each
              other with dignity and consideration in all interactions.
            </p>
            You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s
            fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid
            name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone
            instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk contradiction. Instead,
            provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communicate with empathy.</strong> Disagreements or
            differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community
            means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and
            perspectives, many of which may not be your own. If you disagree
            with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you
            address them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere
            where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in
            discussions, and making contributions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Improve the discussion.</strong> Help us make this a great
              place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion
              in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to
              the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again
              later.
            </p>
            The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if
            they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people
            discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being
            said.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Be clear and stay on topic.</strong> Communicating with
              strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It’s hard to convey or
              read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use
              clear language, and think about how it will be received by the
              other person.
            </p>
            <p>
              This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in the
              Community Forum should be shared with the intent of providing
              relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted
              to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should
              always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and
              purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones,
              without relevant and valuable context can come across as
              advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.
            </p>
            Additionally, the GitHub Community Forum is for collaboration,
            sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic
            comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from
            getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps
            produce positive and productive discussions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Share mindfully.</strong> When asking others to give you
              feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and
              relevant resources to provide context. Don’t post links that don’t
              add value to the Topic, and don’t post unsolicited links to your
              own projects or sites on other user’s threads.
            </p>
            Additionally, don’t share sensitive information. This includes your
            own email address. We don’t allow the sharing of such information in
            this Community Forum, as it can create security and privacy risks
            for the poster, as well as other users. If you’d like to invite
            other Forum members to collaborate on a project or work with you,
            share a link to the repository in which the project you are working
            on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo - with some
            information on what your project is and what kind of help or
            feedback you’re looking for - you can invite others to collaborate
            with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your
            private information. You can also add others as outside
            collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions
            to help you develop your project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep it tidy.</strong> Make the effort to put things in the
            right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time
            cleaning up. So:
            <ul>
              <li>Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.</li>
              <li>Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>
              <li>Don’t post no-content replies.</li>
              <li>
                Don’t “bump” posts, unless you have new and relevant information
                to share.
              </li>
              <li>Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Kudos button. Rather
              than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction,
              open a new topic.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Be trustworthy.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Always be honest.</strong> Don’t knowingly share incorrect
            information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community Forum
            members. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but
            still want to help, you can try helping them research or find
            resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in the
            Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator
            will be able to help.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="what-is-not-allowed"><em>What is not Allowed</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Threats of violence.</strong> You may not threaten violence
          towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of
          real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you
          use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how
          they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a
          joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone
          else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting
          violence or terrorism, stop. Don’t post it on GitHub. In extraordinary
          cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we
          think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to
          public safety.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Hate speech and discrimination.</strong> While it is not
          forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, disability,
          ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
          nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
          and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or
          group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that when
          approached in an aggressive or insulting manner, these (and other)
          sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even
          unsafe. While there’s always the potential for misunderstandings, we
          expect our community members to remain respectful and civil when
          discussing sensitive topics.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Bullying and harassment.</strong> We do not tolerate bullying
          or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation
          targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your
          actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there’s a
          good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Disrupting the experience of other users.</strong> Being part of a
      community includes recognizing how your behavior affects others and
      engaging in meaningful and productive interactions with people and the
      platform they rely on. Behaviors such as repeatedly posting off-topic
      comments, opening empty or meaningless topics or using any other platform
      feature in a way that continually disrupts the experience of other users
      are not allowed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Impersonation.</strong> You may not impersonate another person
          by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address,
          using a similar username or otherwise posing as someone else.
          Impersonation is a form of harassment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Doxxing and invasion of privacy.</strong> Don’t post other
          people’s personal information, such as personal, private email
          addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, credit card numbers,
          Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on
          the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may
          consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken
          or distributed without the subject’s consent, to be an invasion of
          privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the
          subject.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sexually obscene content.</strong> Don’t post content that is
          pornographic. This does not mean that all nudity, or all code and
          content related to sexuality, is prohibited. We recognize that
          sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be
          a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or
          artistic purposes. We do not allow obscene sexual content or content
          that may involve the exploitation or sexualization of minors. If you
          have any questions or concerns about something you want to post,
          <a href="https://github.com/contact"
            >feel free to reach out and ask</a
          >
          beforehand.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Spam.</strong> Respect the GitHub Community Forum. Don’t post
          advertisements, link to spammy websites, ping or mention long lists of
          usernames inappropriately or otherwise vandalize the Community. This
          Community is meant for GitHub users to discuss projects, learn, and
          share ideas with one another - not for advertising or other spam-like
          content. Content that we deem spammy will be removed. Please see our
          <a
            href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#4-spam-and-inauthentic-activity-on-github"
            >GitHub Acceptable Use Policies</a
          >
          for additional detail on spam and inauthentic activity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Copyrighted or illegal content.</strong> Only post your own
          stuff. You are responsible for what you post. If you post something
          you didn’t create yourself, you must have the right to post it. You
          may not post illegal content, including content illegal under
          copyright and trademark laws, links to illegal content, or methods for
          circumventing the law.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Gratuitously violent content.</strong> Don’t post violent
          images, text, or other content without reasonable context or warnings.
          While it’s often okay to include violent content in video games, news
          reports, and descriptions of historical events, we do not allow
          violent content that is posted indiscriminately, or that is posted in
          a way that makes it difficult for other users to avoid (such as a
          profile avatar, profile description, topic or reply). A clear warning
          or disclaimer in other contexts helps users make an educated decision
          as to whether or not they want to engage with such content.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Active malware or exploits.</strong> Being part of a community
          includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do
          not allow anyone to use our platform in direct support of unlawful
          attacks that cause technical harms, such as using GitHub as a means to
          deliver malicious executables or as attack infrastructure, for example
          by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and
          control servers. Technical harms means overconsumption of resources,
          physical damage, downtime, denial of service, or data loss, with no
          implicit or explicit dual-use purpose prior to the abuse occurring.
          Note that GitHub allows dual-use content and supports the posting of
          content that is used for research into vulnerabilities, malware, or
          exploits, as the publication and distribution of such content has
          educational value and provides a net benefit to the security
          community. We assume positive intention and use of these projects to
          promote and drive improvements across the ecosystem. Please see our
          <a
            href="/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#active-malware-or-exploits"
            >GitHub Community Guidelines</a

          for complete detail on this section.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Misinformation and disinformation.</strong> You may not post
          content that presents a distorted view of reality, whether it is
          inaccurate or false (misinformation) or is intentionally deceptive
          (disinformation) where such content is likely to result in harm to the
          public or to interfere with fair and equal opportunities for all to
          participate in public life. For example, we do not allow content that
          may put the well-being of groups of people at risk or limit their
          ability to take part in a free and open society. We encourage active
          participation in the expression of ideas, perspectives, and
          experiences and may not be in a position to dispute personal accounts
          or observations. We generally allow parody and satire that is in line
          with our Acceptable Use Polices, and we consider context to be
          important in how information is received and understood; therefore, it
          may be appropriate to clarify your intentions via disclaimers or other
          means, as well as the source(s) of your information.

          <strong>Anyone under the age of 13.</strong> If you’re a child under
          the age of 13, you may not have an account on the GitHub Community
          Forum (or GitHub itself). GitHub does not knowingly collect
          information from or direct any of our content specifically to children
          under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user
          who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close both
          your GitHub Community Forum and GitHub.com accounts. We don’t want to
          discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please
          see our

          <strong>If you see a problem, report it.</strong> Moderators have
          special authority; they are responsible for this Community. But so are
          you. With your help, moderators can be Community facilitators, not
          just janitors or police.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior
          by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time.
          Just report it via “Report Inappropriate Content” in the Option Menu.
          If enough reports accrue, action will be taken, either automatically
          or by moderator intervention.

    <h3 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to
      inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact
      circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may
      say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did
      not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let
      their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks
      who just want to spam or cause trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response
      to meet the needs of the situation. We’ll review each situation on a
      case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate
      the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this
      Code of Conduct to guide our decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are
      not limited to: - Content Removal - Content Blocking - Community Forum
      Account Suspension - Community Forum Account Termination
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Forum moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of
      Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
      determined by other members of the Community Forum’s leadership.

      participate by being respectful of them and their time.
