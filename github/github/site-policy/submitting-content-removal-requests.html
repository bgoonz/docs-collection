    <p>
      We understand that copyrighted, trademarked, or private content may get
      published on GitHub – either accidentally or on purpose – sometimes in
      repositories that you do not own. Because the nature of this content
      varies, and because of different applicable laws, each category has its
      own, distinct reporting requirements outlined in our policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’d like to request that content be removed from GitHub, please take
      some time to acquaint yourself with each of these policies and their
      respective reporting requirements before submitting a report. If we
      receive an incomplete report, we’ll need to ask for clarifications or
      revisions and you’ll need to re-submit a revised report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that we’re not able to help you determine which policy is
      appropriate for your specific situation. If you’ve reviewed the policies
      below and still have questions about whether or not content should be
      reported as copyright, trademark, or private information, we recommend
      consulting with independent legal counsel.

      <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy">DMCA Takedown Policy</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The DMCA Takedown Policy can be used to report content that you believe
      infringes a copyright owned by you or your organization. Once you have
      reviewed the policy, you may also want to review our

      <a href="/articles/github-trademark-policy">GitHub Trademark Policy</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The GitHub Trademark Policy can be used to report content that appears to
      use your company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected
      materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others about brand or
      business affiliation.

        >GitHub Private Information Removal Policy</a
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      The GitHub Private Information Removal Policy can be used to report data
      that is private (confidential and poses a security risk), but that is not
      necessarily protected by copyright or trademark.
