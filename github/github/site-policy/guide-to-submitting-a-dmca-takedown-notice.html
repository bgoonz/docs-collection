      This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process
      a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the
      DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our
      <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy">DMCA Takedown Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way
      that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific
      as possible. These guidelines are designed to make the processing of
      alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible. Our form of
      notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA
      statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office’s official
      website:
      <a href="https://www.copyright.gov" class="uri"
        >https://www.copyright.gov</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a
      professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly
      encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your
      rights. This guide isn’t legal advice and shouldn’t be taken as such.
    </p>
    <h2 id="before-you-start">Before You Start</h2>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Tell the Truth.</em></strong> The DMCA requires that you swear
      to the facts in your copyright complaint
      <em>under penalty of perjury</em>. It is a federal crime to intentionally
      lie in a sworn declaration. (<em>See</em>
      <a
        href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap79-sec1621.htm"
        >U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621</a
      >.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability —
      that is, you could get sued for money damages. The DMCA itself
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#%C2%A7_512(f)_Misrepresentations"
        >provides for damages</a
      >
      against any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or
      activity is infringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Investigate.</em></strong> Millions of users and organizations
      pour their hearts and souls into the projects they create and contribute
      to on GitHub. Filing a DMCA complaint against such a project is a serious
      legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people. Because
      of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with
      an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure that the use isn’t
      actually permissible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Ask Nicely First.</em></strong> A great first step before
      sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly. They
      may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the
      repository’s README, or you could get in touch by opening an issue or pull
      request on the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is
      classy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Send In The Correct Request.</em></strong> We can only accept
      DMCA takedown notices for works that are protected by copyright, and that
      identify a specific copyrightable work. If you have a complaint about
      trademark abuse, please see our
      <a href="/articles/github-trademark-policy/">trademark policy</a>. If you
      wish to remove sensitive data such as passwords, please see our
      <a href="/articles/github-sensitive-data-removal-policy/"
        >policy on sensitive data</a
      >. If you are dealing with defamation or other abusive behavior, please
      see our
      <a href="/articles/github-community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Code Is Different From Other Creative Content.</em></strong>
      GitHub is built for collaboration on software code. This makes identifying
      a valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be
      for, say, photos, music, or videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of reasons why code is different from other creative
      content. For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A repository may include bits and pieces of code from many different
        people, but only one file or even a sub-routine within a file infringes
        your copyrights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code mixes functionality with creative expression, but copyright only
        protects the expressive elements, not the parts that are functional.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are often licenses to consider. Just because a piece of code has a
        copyright notice does not necessarily mean that it is infringing. It is
        possible that the code is being used in accordance with an open-source
        license.
      </li>
      <li>
        A particular use may be
        <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair-use</a> if it
        only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a
        transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some
        combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such
        uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code may be alleged to infringe in many different ways, requiring
        detailed explanations and identifications of works.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This list isn’t exhaustive, which is why speaking to a legal professional
      about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>No Bots.</em></strong> You should have a trained professional
      evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send. If you are
      outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they
      operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit
      complaints in bulk. These complaints are often invalid and processing them
      results in needlessly taking down projects!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Matters of Copyright Are Hard.</em></strong> It can be very
      difficult to determine whether or not a particular work is protected by
      copyright. For example, facts (including data) are generally not
      copyrightable. Words and short phrases are generally not copyrightable.
      URLs and domain names are generally not copyrightable. Since you can only
      use the DMCA process to target content that is protected by copyright, you
      should speak with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not your
      content is protectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>You May Receive a Counter Notice.</em></strong> Any user
      affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a
      <a href="/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice"
        >counter notice</a
      >. If they do, we will re-enable their content within 10-14 days unless
      you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain
      the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on
      GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Your Complaint Will Be Published.</em></strong> As noted in
      our
      <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#d-transparency"
        >DMCA Takedown Policy</a
      >, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and
      actionable takedown notices at
      <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca" class="uri"
        >https://github.com/github/dmca</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>GitHub Isn’t The Judge.</em></strong> GitHub exercises little
      discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet
      the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their
      lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that
      notices must be made under penalty of perjury.
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Include the following statement: “I have read and understand
            GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.”</strong
          >
          We won’t refuse to process an otherwise complete complaint if you
          don’t include this statement. But we’ll know that you haven’t read
          these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been
            infringed.</strong
          >
          This information is important because it helps the affected user
          evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to
          theirs. The specificity of your identification will depend on the
          nature of the work you believe has been infringed. If you have
          published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page
          where it lives. If it is proprietary and not published, you might
          describe it and explain that it is proprietary. If you have registered
          it with the Copyright Office, you should include the registration
          number. If you are alleging that the hosted content is a direct,
          literal copy of your work, you can also just explain that fact.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted
          work listed in item #2, above.</strong
        >
        It is important to be as specific as possible in your identification.
        This identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit GitHub
        to locate the material. At a minimum, this means that you should include
        the URL to the material allegedly infringing your copyright. If you
        allege that less than a whole repository infringes, identify the
        specific file(s) or line numbers within a file that you allege infringe.
        If you allege that all of the content at a URL infringes, please be
        explicit about that as well.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please note that GitHub will <em>not</em> automatically disable
            <a
              href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork"
              >forks</a
            >
            when disabling a parent repository. If you have investigated and
            analyzed the forks of a repository and believe that they are also
            infringing, please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing
            fork. Please also confirm that you have investigated each individual
            case and that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork.
            In rare cases, you may be alleging copyright infringement in a full
            repository that is actively being forked. If at the time that you
            submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that
            repository as allegedly infringing, we would process a valid claim
            against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice.
            We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks
            would contain the same content. In addition, if the reported network
            that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one
            hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in
            its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you
            state in your notice that, “Based on the representative number of
            forks you have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are
            infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.” Your sworn
            statement would apply to this statement.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy
            the infringement.</strong
          >
          Again, specificity is important. When we pass your complaint along to
          the user, this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid
          having the rest of their content disabled. Does the user just need to
          add a statement of attribution? Do they need to delete certain lines
          within their code, or entire files? Of course, we understand that in
          some cases, all of a user’s content may be alleged to infringe and
          there’s nothing they could do short of deleting it all. If that’s the
          case, please make that clear as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Provide your contact information.</strong> Include your email

          Usually this will be satisfied by providing the GitHub username
          associated with the allegedly infringing content. But there may be
          cases where you have additional knowledge about the alleged infringer.
          If so, please share that information with us.

    <p>
      The Copyright Act also prohibits the circumvention of technological
      measures that effectively control access to works protected by copyright.
      If you believe that content hosted on GitHub violates this prohibition,
      please send us a report through our {% data variables.contact.contact_dmca
      %}. A circumvention claim must include the following details about the
      technical measures in place and the manner in which the accused project
      circumvents them. Specifically, the notice to GitHub must include detailed
      statements that describe: 1. What the technical measures are; 2. How they
      effectively control access to the copyrighted material; and 3. How the
      accused project is designed to circumvent their previously described
      technological protection measures.
