    <p><em>2018 statement</em></p>
    <p>
      According to the International Labour Organization (ILO),
      <a
        href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_574717/lang--en/index.htm"
        >40 million people were victims of modern slavery and 152 million
        children were subject to child labor</a
      >
      globally in 2016. As the
      <a
        href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm"
        >ILO reports</a
      >: - 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children. - Out of the 24.9
      million people trapped in forced labour, 16 million people are exploited
      in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture;
      4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons
      in forced labour imposed by state authorities. - Women and girls are
      disproportionately affected by forced labour, accounting for 99% of
      victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub deplores the presence and persistence of modern slavery and child
      labor, and takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that neither
      modern slavery nor child labor takes place in its supply chain or in any
      part of its business. (“Modern slavery” in this statement refers to
      slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, and workers
      who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded. “Child labor” refers to work
      performed by someone under 16 years of age, or under 14 for light work,
      provided it is not confined to periods that interfere with the child’s
      schooling and not in conditions that interfere with the child’s health or
      well-being.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the
      <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/section/54/enacted"
        >UK Modern Slavery Act</a
      >, and in alignment with the
      <a
        href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:P029"
        >ILO 2014 Protocol to its Forced Labour Convention</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://www.ilo.org/declaration/thedeclaration/textdeclaration/lang--en/index.htm"
        >ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work</a
      >, and
      <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg8"
        >United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target 8.7</a
      >, this 2018 Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor (“the
      Statement”) describes the steps GitHub has taken to prevent modern slavery
      and child labor from occurring in its business or supply chain.

    <h2 id="githubs-structure-business-and-supply-chains">
      GitHub’s structure, business, and supply chains
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is a software development platform with its headquarters in San
      Francisco, and employees and contractors working in numerous countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      All GitHub employees and individual independent contractors are voluntary
      and at-will. GitHub has a largely distributed workforce, and strives to
      provide competitive compensation and benefits to its employees and
      contractors regardless of location. This is true whether we hire
      independent contractors directly or through an intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub does not conduct manufacturing or produce hardware, nor does GitHub
      use recruitment agencies for the kinds of services often performed by
      migrant workers. The nature of GitHub’s business does not subject it to
      sudden changes in workload or pricing pressures, which often drive demand
      for practices that increase the risk of forced labor in supply chains,
      such as forced overtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub offers free and paid software and web-based software as a service
      to customers all over the world. GitHub’s products include: - GitHub.com:
      web-based collaboration and code-hosting platform - GitHub Enterprise:
      on-premises collaboration and code hosting software - Atom: text editor -
      Electron: framework for writing cross-platform desktop apps - GitHub
      Desktop: desktop app for accessing GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s supply chain consists of goods and services for our products and
      operations including computing services, event planning, purchase of
      retail and promotional items, office supplies, and leasing of facilities
      such as office space and data centers.

      Policies in relation to modern slavery and child labor
    </h2>
    <h3 id="modern-slavery-and-child-labor">Modern slavery and child labor</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>GitHub’s Code of Ethics</strong> prohibits knowingly using,
      participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery,
      forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are
      imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor in its business
      operations. Any GitHub employee or contractor who violates this
      prohibition will be subject to termination of employment or business
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>GitHub’s Standards of Conduct</strong> prohibit unsafe and illegal
      conduct, including knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or
      tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor,
      trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or
      bonded) or child labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub complies with laws prohibiting trafficking and child labor in the
      jurisdictions in which it operates, including
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2009-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2009-title48-vol1-part22-subpart22-17.pdf"
        >U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation 22.17 on combatting human
        trafficking</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, GitHub established a partnership with the FairHotel Program,
      which means GitHub encourages its employees to choose FairHotel endorsed
      hotels-where workers have fair wages, adequate benefits, and a voice on
      the job. Being a FairHotel partner also signifies that GitHub provides
      business to hotels as a fair employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going forward, GitHub will communicate this Statement to all employees,
      contractors, and suppliers, including recruiters and employment agencies.
      In addition, GitHub is developing training for all GitHub employees on
      modern slavery and child labor. GitHub
      <a
        href="/articles/github-statement-against-modern-slavery-and-child-labor"
        >posts its Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor publicly</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub has a non-retaliation policy for reporting workplace-related
      concerns. Consistent with this Statement, GitHub allows employees and
      contractors to report issues regarding modern slavery and child labor
      without fear of retaliation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="labor-laws-and-practices">Labor laws and practices</h2>
    <p>GitHub’s labor practices are</p>
    <p>
      <strong>fair</strong>: - GitHub pays its employees and contractors a fair
      wage, in accordance with applicable legal wages - GitHub maintains humane
      working conditions - GitHub does not require workers to exceed the maximum
      hours of daily labor set by local and national laws or regulations -
      GitHub pays its employees and contractors in a timely manner, with
      documentation (such as a pay stub) stating the basis on which they are
      paid, and keeps employee records in accordance with local and national
      laws
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>humane and ethical</strong>: - GitHub uses only voluntary labor -
      GitHub prohibits child labor - GitHub does not engage in physical
      discipline or abuse - GitHub does not tolerate harassment or unlawful
      discrimination in the workforce or workplace
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>respectful</strong>: - GitHub protects its employees’ rights to
      freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with legal
      requirements, including to post legal notices of employees’ rights under
      the National Labor Relations Act - GitHub provides benefits to employees
      at or in excess of levels expected in the industry - GitHub encourages
      employees to report any workplace complaint and does not tolerate
      retaliation for reporting

      Due diligence processes in relation to modern slavery and child labor in
      its business and supply chains
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub assesses its business and supply chain for risks related to modern
      slavery and child labor. Drawing on internal and external human rights
      expertise, GitHub engaged in a cross-functional analysis (including
      Policy, Legal, Procurement, Finance, and Operations, especially Human
      Resources) to determine where labor services exist in its business and
      supply chain and to identify potential risks related to modern slavery and
      child labor. GitHub prioritizes areas where those risks might be more
      significant in terms of severity, scale, or probability for greater due
      diligence, monitoring, and verification. GitHub continues to consider
      where risks may occur and how to address them. In addition, GitHub now
      obtains its suppliers’ assurance that they have practices consistent with
      this Statement, including by complying with laws related to modern slavery
      or child labor.
    </p>
    <h2

    >
      Places in GitHub’s business and supply chains where there is a risk of
      modern slavery and child labor, and steps GitHub has taken to assess and
      manage that risk
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub has not identified any high-risk suppliers; however, modern slavery
      or child labor would be more likely to occur with suppliers for services
      involving manual labor, such as event support, construction, facilities
      services, and food services. GitHub will audit its existing suppliers and
      require those in such higher risk areas to confirm that they provide
      services consistent with this Statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although GitHub knows of no actual or alleged modern slavery or child
      labor in its business or supply chain, and has no credible basis to
      believe it is occurring, GitHub is committed to providing remedies if
      GitHub itself were to directly cause modern slavery or child labor and to
      remediation of broader patterns of non-conformance with this Statement
      caused by deficiencies in GitHub’s systems or processes. GitHub’s
      remediation to individual victims would include protocols for appropriate
      immediate action to eliminate the modern slavery and child labor
      practices, along with resources for reasonable and appropriate victim
      services designed to offset the harm experienced.

      Effectiveness in ensuring neither modern slavery nor child labor is
      occurring in GitHub’s business or supply chains
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub complies and will continue to comply with laws related to modern
      slavery and child labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going forward, GitHub now requires its suppliers to comply with this
      Statement, as well as laws related to modern slavery and child labor.
      GitHub now also requires its suppliers to: - not use, participate in,
      support, or tolerate modern slavery or child labor - not use misleading or
      fraudulent recruitment or engagement practices for employees or contract
      workers - not charge employees or contract workers recruitment or
      engagement fees - not destroy, conceal, confiscate, or otherwise deny
      access by an employee or any contract worker to passport, driver’s
      license, or other identity documents; - allow us to terminate our
      agreements with them for any violation of its obligations related to
      modern slavery or child labor; and - remediate any harms caused to any
      worker found to be subjected to any form of modern slavery or child labor,
      if required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, GitHub strongly encourages its suppliers to: - conduct
      anti-modern slavery and child labor due diligence processes, including
      risk assessments, for their suppliers; - take steps to address risks
      identified; and - use similar anti-modern slavery and child labor language
      with their suppliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s procurement instructions to employees making company purchases
      now includes a reference to the requirement for suppliers to comply with
      Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct or this Statement.

      Training for GitHub staff about modern slavery and human trafficking
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is developing modern slavery and child labor training that will be
      mandatory for all employees, with a view to GitHub’s business and supply
      chain. GitHub will emphasize suppliers providing services involving manual
      labor, such as event support, construction, facilities services, and food
      services, as areas of greater potential risk.
