    <p>
      GitHub account names are available on a first-come, first-served basis,
      and are intended for immediate and active use.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-if-the-username-i-want-is-already-taken">
      What if the username I want is already taken?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that not all activity on GitHub is publicly visible; accounts
      with no visible activity may be in active use.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the username you want has already been claimed, consider other names or
      unique variations. Using a number, hyphen, or an alternative spelling
      might help you identify a desirable username still available.
    </p>
    <h2 id="trademark-policy">Trademark Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe someoneâ€™s account is violating your trademark rights, you
      can find more information about making a trademark complaint on our
      <a href="/articles/github-trademark-policy/">Trademark Policy</a> page.
    </p>
    <h2 id="name-squatting-policy">Name Squatting Policy</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be
      reserved or inactively held for future use. Accounts violating this name
      squatting policy may be removed or renamed without notice. Attempts to
      sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names
      are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.
