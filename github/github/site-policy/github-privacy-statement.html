      How we share the information we collect
    </h2>
    <p>
      We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one
      of the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <h3 id="with-your-consent">With your consent</h3>
    <p>
      We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you
      know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, if
      you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your
      username to allow the application Developer to provide you with services.
      Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share
      your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an Organization,
      you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization
      with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.
    </p>
    <h3 id="with-service-providers">With service providers</h3>
    <p>
      We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service
      providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service,
      and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our
      Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar
      commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer
      support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar
      services. While GitHub processes all User Personal Information in the
      United States, our service providers may process data outside of the
      United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our
      service providers are, please see our page on
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies"
        >Subprocessors</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="for-security-purposes">For security purposes</h3>
    <p>
      If you are a member of an Organization, GitHub may share your username,
      <a href="#usage-information">Usage Information</a>, and
      <a href="#device-information">Device Information</a> associated with that
      Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization, to
      the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or
      respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of
      that particular Organization.
    </p>
    <h3 id="for-legal-disclosure">For legal disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal
      obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in
      rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users
      of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information.
      GitHub may disclose User Personal Information or other information we
      collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid
      subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when
      we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our
      legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third
      parties or the public at large.

    </p>
    <h3 id="change-in-control-or-sale">Change in control or sale</h3>
    <p>
      We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger,
      sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such
      change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that
      preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will
      notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User
      Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal
      Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy
      Statement or Terms of Service.

    <h3 id="aggregate-non-personally-identifying-information">
      Aggregate, non-personally identifying information
    </h3>
    <p>
      We share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with
      others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users
      respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.
    </p>
    <p>
      We <strong>do not</strong> sell your User Personal Information for
      monetary or other consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires
      businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose
      personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable
      consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, we voluntarily
      extend its core rights for people to control their data to <em>all</em> of
      our users, not just those who live in California. You can learn more about

      our legal obligations - if we have reason to believe the contents are in
      violation of the law, or - with your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, while we do not generally search for content in your
      repositories, we may scan our servers and content to detect certain tokens
      or security signatures, known active malware, known vulnerabilities in
      dependencies, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service, such
      as violent extremist or terrorist content or child exploitation imagery,
      based on algorithmic fingerprinting techniques (collectively, “automated

      Please note, you may choose to disable certain access to your private
      repositories that is enabled by default as part of providing you with the
      Service (for example, automated scanning needed to enable Dependency Graph
      and Dependabot alerts).
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository
      content, unless

    <h2 id="other-important-information">Other important information</h2>
    <h3 id="public-information-on-github">Public information on GitHub</h3>
    <p>
      Many of GitHub services and features are public-facing. If your content is
      public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our
      Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or
      pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours.
      However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or
      archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Other third
      parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and
      compile data as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your User Personal Information associated with your content could be
      gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do
      not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties’
      compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your User Personal
      Information publicly available and be sure to
      <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails"
        >configure your email address to be private in your user profile</a

        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address"
        >git commit settings</a
      >. We currently set Users’ email address to private by default, but legacy
      GitHub Users may need to update their settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms
      of Service regarding
      <a
        href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#6-information-usage-restrictions"
        >information usage</a

      and
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#7-privacy"
        >privacy</a
      >, and you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you
      gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example,
      where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the
      purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address
      for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling User
      Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards,
      or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any User
      Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond
      promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests
      from GitHub or GitHub users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available User Personal
      Information collected as part of the collaborative process. If you have a
      complaint about any User Personal Information on GitHub, please see our

    <p>
      You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to
      share your User Personal Information. If you collaborate on or become a
      member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your User
      Personal Information. When you accept an invitation to an Organization,
      you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see
      (for more information, see
      <a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership"

      comply with applicable data privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Please
      note that GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to
      your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to
      comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity
      of the Website and the Service.

      different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all GitHub

      Transmission of data on GitHub is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS (TLS), and
      git repository content is encrypted at rest. We manage our own cages and
      racks at top-tier data centers with high level of physical and network
      security, and when data is stored with a third-party storage provider, it
      is encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
      secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more
      information, see our

      GitHub’s global privacy practices
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub, Inc. and, for those in the European Economic Area, the United
      Kingdom, and Switzerland, GitHub B.V. are the controllers responsible for
      the processing of your personal information in connection with the
      Service, except (a) with respect to personal information that was added to
      a repository by its contributors, in which case the owner of that
      repository is the controller and GitHub is the processor (or, if the owner
      acts as a processor, GitHub will be the subprocessor); or (b) when you and
      GitHub have entered into a separate agreement that covers data privacy
      (such as a Data Processing Agreement).
    </p>
    <p>Our addresses are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
      </li>
      <li>
        GitHub B.V., Vijzelstraat 68-72, 1017 HL Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We store and process the information that we collect in the United States
      in accordance with this Privacy Statement, though our service providers
      may store and process data outside the United States. However, we
      understand that we have Users from different countries and regions with
      different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when
      the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide the same high standard of privacy protection—as described in
      this Privacy Statement—to all our users around the world, regardless of
      their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of
      notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and
      recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data
      privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection
      Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy
      compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access
      to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them
      to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.
    </p>
    <p>In particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed, specific, and
        freely given consent at the time of data collection, when we collect
        your User Personal Information using consent as a basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        We collect only the minimum amount of User Personal Information
        necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We
        encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable
        sharing.
      </li>
      <li>
        We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User
        Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and
        access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the
        purpose for processing it. We also provide our Users a method of
        recourse and enforcement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="cross-border-data-transfers">Cross-border data transfers</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub processes personal information both inside and outside of the
      United States and relies on Standard Contractual Clauses as the legally
      provided mechanism to lawfully transfer data from the European Economic
      Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. In
      addition, GitHub is certified to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
      Frameworks. To learn more about our cross-border data transfers, see our
      <a href="/github/site-policy/global-privacy-practices"
        >Global Privacy Practices</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-we-communicate-with-you">How we communicate with you</h2>
    <p>
      We use your email address to communicate with you, if you’ve said that’s
      okay, <strong>and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay</strong>.
      For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to
      you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is
      used and shared on and through GitHub. You may manage your communication
      preferences in your
      <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">user profile</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a
      User’s email address, such as commit messages. We are not able to change
      many aspects of the Git system. If you would like your email address to
      remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories,
      <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails"
        >you can create a private email address in your user profile</a
      >. You should also
      <a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address"
        >update your local Git configuration to use your private email
        address</a
      >. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others
      see you. We set current Users’ email address private by default, but
      legacy GitHub Users may need to update their settings. Please see more
      about email addresses in commit messages
      <a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on your
      <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">email settings</a>, GitHub
      may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository
      you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy
      changes, or to offer customer support. We also send marketing emails,
      based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and
      regulations. There’s an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each
      of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you cannot opt out
      of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our
      Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications
      settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our emails may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can
      tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address
      is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to
      make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.

      30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home
      page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your
      GitHub account. We will also update our
      <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy/">Site Policy repository</a
