      GitHub provides the same high standard of privacy protection—as described
      in GitHub’s
      <a
        href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#githubs-global-privacy-practices"
        >Privacy Statement</a
      >—to all our users and customers around the world, regardless of their
      country of origin or location, and GitHub is proud of the level of notice,
      choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we
      provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub also complies with certain legal frameworks relating to the
      transfer of data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and
      Switzerland (collectively, “EU”) to the United States. When GitHub engages
      in such transfers, GitHub relies on Standard Contractual Clauses as the
      legal mechanism to help ensure your rights and protections travel with
      your personal information. In addition, GitHub is certified to the EU-US
      and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. To learn more about the European
      Commission’s decisions on international data transfer, see this article on
      the
      <a
        href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en"
        >European Commission website</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="standard-contractual-clauses">Standard Contractual Clauses</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual
      Clauses (“SCCs”) as a legal mechanism for data transfers from the EU. SCCs
      are contractual commitments between companies transferring personal data,
      binding them to protect the privacy and security of such data. GitHub
      adopted SCCs so that the necessary data flows can be protected when
      transferred outside the EU to countries which have not been deemed by the
      European Commission to adequately protect personal data, including
      protecting data transfers to the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more about SCCs, see this article on the
      <a
        href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"
        >European Commission website</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="privacy-shield-framework">Privacy Shield Framework</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is certified to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks
      and the commitments they entail, although GitHub does not rely on the
      EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal
      information in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in
      Case C-311/18.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks are set forth by the US
      Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
      User Personal Information transferred from the European Union, the UK, and
      Switzerland to the United States. GitHub has certified to the Department
      of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If our
      vendors or affiliates process User Personal Information on our behalf in a
      manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield
      Framework, GitHub remains liable unless we prove we are not responsible
      for the event giving rise to the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of our certifications under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, if
      there is any conflict between the terms in these Global Privacy Practices
      and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall
      govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
      certification, visit the
      <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Privacy Shield Frameworks are based on seven principles, and GitHub
      adheres to them in the following ways:

      <li>
        <strong>Notice</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>

          <li>
            We let you know, in our
            <a href="/articles/github-privacy-statement/">Privacy Statement</a>,
            what purposes we have for collecting and using your information, who
            we share that information with and under what restrictions, and what
            access you have to your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            We let you know that we’re participating in the Privacy Shield
            framework, and what that means to you.

            We have a {% data variables.contact.contact_privacy %} where you can
            contact us with questions about your privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            We let you know about your right to invoke binding arbitration,
            provided at no cost to you, in the unlikely event of a dispute.
          </li>
          <li>
            We let you know that we are subject to the jurisdiction of the
            Federal Trade Commission.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choice</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We let you choose what happens to your data. Before we use your data

            will let you know and get your permission.
          </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accountability for Onward Transfer</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When we transfer your information to third party vendors that are
            processing it on our behalf, we are only sending your data to third
            parties, under contract with us, that will safeguard it consistently
            with our Privacy Statement. When we transfer your data to our
            vendors under Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            We share only the amount of data with our third party vendors as is
            necessary to complete their transaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

            our services to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            We collect as little information about you as we can, unless you
            choose to give us more.
          </li>
          <li>
            We take reasonable steps to ensure that the data we have about you
            is accurate, current, and reliable for its intended use.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are always able to access the data we have about you in your

            access to binding arbitration at no cost to you. Please see our

            for more information.
          </li>
          <li>

    <h3 id="dispute-resolution-process">Dispute resolution process</h3>
    <p>
      As further explained in the
      <a
        href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#resolving-complaints"
        >Resolving Complaints</a
      >
      section of our
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement"
        >Privacy Statement</a
      >, we encourage you to contact us should you have a Privacy Shield-related
      (or general privacy-related) complaint. For any complaints that cannot be
      resolved with GitHub directly, we have selected to cooperate with the
      relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the
      European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU
      individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information
      Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please
      contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection
      authority contacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the
      right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
    </p>
    <h3 id="independent-arbitration">Independent arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      Under certain limited circumstances, EU, European Economic Area (EEA),
      Swiss, and UK individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as
      a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been
      unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its
      availability to you, please read more about
      <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction"
        >Privacy Shield</a
      >. Arbitration is not mandatory; it is a tool you can use if you so
      choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are subject to the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission
      (FTC).
