    <p>
      GitHub upholds our commitment to ethical business practices, including by
      prohibiting bribery and corruption. As
      <a
        href="https://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption#costs-of-corruption"
        >Transparency International</a
      >
      explains, the costs of corruption are - <strong>political</strong>, by
      posing a major obstacle to democracy and the rule of law -
      <strong>economic</strong>, by depleting national wealth -
      <strong>social</strong>, by undermining people’s trust in political
      society, institutions, and leaders - <strong>environmental</strong>, by
      facilitating non-enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the
      <a
        href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/governance/brief/anti-corruption"
        >World Bank</a
      >
      in 2017, businesses and individuals pay an estimated $1.5 trillion in
      bribes each year.

    <h2 id="github-policies-prohibiting-bribery">
      GitHub policies prohibiting bribery
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub makes our anti-bribery commitment clear in a number of company
      policies. As part of the Microsoft family, GitHub is also committed to
      Microsoft’s Anti-Corruption Policy, which applies to all GitHub employees
      and contractors, in addition to the policies described here.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s <strong>Code of Ethics</strong> prohibits employees and
      contractors from engaging in or contributing to bribery or corruption, and
      establishes record-keeping requirements:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You must never pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, induce, accept, or
        authorize payment of anything else of value, to anyone—including to
        anyone in a position of power or authority, such as government
        officials, or in commercial transactions—in order to obtain or keep
        business, or secure any other improper advantage for GitHub or
        Microsoft. You also must not solicit or accept a bribe, kickback, or any
        other improper cash payment. … [GitHub employees] are required to keep
        accurate and fair records of all transactions involving any expense made
        on GitHub’s behalf—for example, by keeping receipts and providing
        accurate descriptions of your expenses—or any other transaction
        involving the disposal or transfer of GitHub assets. Such actions are
        required by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act
        of 2010, and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which GitHub
        does business and are also simply the right thing to do.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      GitHub’s Code of Ethics elaborates on certain situations, including gifts,
      travel, and entertainment; facilitating payments; charitable donations;
      jobs; and working with representatives, as well as on who is considered a
      government official.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s Standards of Conduct prohibit: &gt;Bribing government officials
      or other individuals to gain an unfair advantage, and taking bribes from
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s <strong>Gifts and Entertainment Policy</strong> explains that
      bribery is not permitted in connection with travel or entertainment, and
      provides examples to illustrate improper conduct. The policy describes
      proper and improper gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses; company
      processes for gift-giving by GitHub’s directors, officers, employees, and
      agents and requirements for record-keeping, penalties; and reporting of
      violations. It includes clear monetary thresholds for gifts along with
      annual limitations, with limited exceptions for gifts approved by
      appropriate management. The policy is clear and easily accessible to
      GitHub employees and contractors.
    </p>
    <h2 id="training-for-our-employees">Training for our employees</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub employees are required to participate in training on corruption,
      including bribery. We also provide additional training for particularly
      relevant people and teams, such as our sales team. The training explains
      relevant elements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.
      Bribery Act of 2010. For example, - definition and structural effects of
      corruption - who is covered, including - public officials or others in a
      position of power - third parties - what kind of activity is covered,
      including - cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment - facilitation payments
      - charitable contributions and sponsorship - for what purpose, including -
      intent - improper advantage or influence - due diligence and red flags -
      record-keeping requirements
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the training covers GitHub’s internal policies related to
      anti-corruption and bribery, including our non-retaliation (whistleblower)
      policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the U.S. FCPA is focused on interactions with government officials,
      the U.K. Bribery Act is broader and extends to bribing anyone, regardless
      of whether they are a government official. Both laws can extend to
      GitHub’s actions elsewhere on the globe. GitHub’s policies prohibit
      bribing anyone, anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <h2 id="engaging-our-partners">Engaging our Partners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        GitHub’s standard
        <strong>resale agreements with Channel Partners</strong> include
        mandatory anti-corruption clauses. Going forward, GitHub now requires
        our Channel Partners to commit to complying with this Anti-Corruption
        Statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Going forward, GitHub’s <strong>vendor contracts</strong> now require a
        commitment to comply with Microsoft’s Supplier Code of Conduct or this
        Anti-Corruption Statement.
