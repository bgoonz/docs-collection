    <p>
      When using {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}, your
      organization is the data controller because your organization determines
      whether, how, and why {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %} will
      process any individual’s personal data. Your organization is solely
      responsible for ensuring that you are complying with all applicable laws
      in processing data with {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}.

    <h2 id="data-privacy-recommendations">Data privacy recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      You have full control over which metrics, reports, repositories, and
      contributors to include before beginning use of {% data
      variables.product.prodname_insights %}. The data you process with {% data
      variables.product.prodname_insights %} can only be pulled from your
      installation of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. Consider
      balancing the risks versus the benefits of analyzing personal data.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Develop a clear analysis plan</strong>: You must understand
          clearly what you want to analyze and why, and then consider how {%
          data variables.product.prodname_insights %} may help you find those
          answers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Consider a data protection impact assessment</strong>: If your
          proposed use of {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}
          involves processing personal data, consider completing a data
          protection impact assessment or otherwise completing formal legal
          analysis of your planned use.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Decide which repositories to include</strong>: Before you
          start an analysis in {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %},
          consider which repositories to include. Administrators can include
          repositories when adding organizations and can enable and disable
          repositories at any time. For more information on adding organizations
          to {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}, see “<a
            href="/insights/installing-and-configuring-github-insights/managing-organizations"
            >Managing organizations</a
          >.” For more information on enabling and disabling repositories, see

      <li>

          <strong>Decide which metrics and reports to include</strong>:
          Administrators can enable and disable metrics and reports available
          for all users at any time. Administrators control the {% data
          variables.product.prodname_insights %} data that users have access to
          in your installation of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server
          %}. For more information, see “<a

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Decide which contributors to include</strong>: Administrators
          can disable a specific contributor’s data from being processed in the
          metrics and reports. For more information on managing contributor
          data, see “<a

    <h2 id="user-rights">User rights</h2>
    <p>
      Under various data protection regulations, such as the General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR), users may have the right to request
      exclusion from processing, access, and correction, or to request deletion
      of their personal data. As the data controller, your organization should
      evaluate whether a particular user request is valid and, if appropriate,
      take action to fulfill the request.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Exclusion of processing</strong>: Users may have the right to
          have their personal data excluded from being processed. Administrators
          have the ability to remove a contributor’s data from being processed
          in {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}, and the resulting
          reports and metrics will exclude the contributor’s data accordingly.
          For more information, see “<a
            href="/insights/installing-and-configuring-github-insights/managing-contributors-and-teams"
            >Managing contributors and teams</a

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Access</strong>: Users may have the right to demand to see
          what personal data is being processed. Each metric and report has a
          detailed description of what personal data is being processed. For
          more information, see “<a
            href="/insights/exploring-your-usage-of-github-enterprise/metrics-available-with-github-insights"
            >Metrics available with {% data variables.product.prodname_insights
            %}</a
          >.” Raw data is available through the {% data
          variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} API. Your organization is
          responsible for any decisions to process personal data and for
          fulfilling any such requests.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Correction and deletion</strong>: Users may have the right to
          rectify or delete their personal data. The data used in {% data
          variables.product.prodname_insights %} is derived from the existing
          data you add to or generate from your {% data
          variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} installation. Correction and
          deletion should follow your organization’s existing process to correct
          and delete data from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Transparency regarding processing</strong>: Each metric and

          processed. For more information, see “<a
