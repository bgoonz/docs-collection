<p>You can view the top 100 contributors to a repository{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}, including commit co-authors,{% endif %} in the contributors graph. Merge commits and empty commits aren’t counted as contributions for this graph.</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt %} You can also see a list of people who have contributed to the project’s Python dependencies. To access this list of community contributors, visit <code>https://github.com/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/community_contributors</code>. {% endif %}</p>
<h2 id="accessing-the-contributors-graph">Accessing the contributors graph</h2>
<p>{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} {% data reusables.repositories.accessing-repository-graphs %} 3. In the left sidebar, click <strong>Contributors</strong>. <img src="/assets/images/help/graphs/contributors_tab.png" alt="Contributors tab" /> 4. Optionally, to view contributors during a specific time period, click, then drag until the time period is selected. The contributors graph sums weekly commit numbers onto each Sunday, so your time period must include a Sunday. <img src="/assets/images/help/graphs/repo_contributors_click_drag_graph.png" alt="Selected time range in the contributors graph" /></p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-contributors">Troubleshooting contributors</h2>
<p>If you don’t appear in a repository’s contributors graph, it may be because: - You aren’t one of the top 100 contributors. - Your commits haven’t been merged into the default branch. - The email address you used to author the commits isn’t connected to your account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.</p>
<p>{% tip %}</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To list all commit contributors in a repository, see “<a href="/rest/reference/repos#list-contributors">Repositories</a>.”</p>
<p>{% endtip %}</p>
<p>If all your commits in the repository are on non-default branches, you won’t be in the contributors graph. For example, commits on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch aren’t included in the graph unless <code>gh-pages</code> is the repository’s default branch. To have your commits merged into the default branch, you can create a pull request. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/about-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>.”</p>
<p>If the email address you used to author the commits is not connected to your account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your commits won’t be linked to your account, and you won’t appear in the contributors graph. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address">Setting your commit email address</a>{% ifversion not ghae %}” and “<a href="/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account">Adding an email address to your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account</a>{% endif %}.”</p>
