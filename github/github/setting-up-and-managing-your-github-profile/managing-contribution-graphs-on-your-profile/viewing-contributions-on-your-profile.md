## What counts as a contribution

On your profile page, certain actions count as contributions:

- Committing to a repository's default branch or `gh-pages` branch
- Opening an issue
- Opening a discussion
- Answering a discussion
- Proposing a pull request
- Submitting a pull request review{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
- Co-authoring commits in a repository's default branch or `gh-pages` branch{% endif %}

{% data reusables.pull_requests.pull_request_merges_and_contributions %}

## Popular repositories

This section displays your repositories with the most watchers. {% ifversion fpt or ghes %}Once you [pin repositories to your profile](/articles/pinning-repositories-to-your-profile), this section will change to "Pinned repositories."{% endif %}

![Popular repositories](/assets/images/help/profile/profile_popular_repositories.png)

{% ifversion fpt or ghes %}

## Pinned repositories

This section displays up to six public repositories and can include your repositories as well as repositories you've contributed to. To easily see important details about the repositories you've chosen to feature, each repository in this section includes a summary of the work being done, the number of [stars](/articles/saving-repositories-with-stars/) the repository has received, and the main programming language used in the repository. For more information, see "[Pinning repositories to your profile](/articles/pinning-repositories-to-your-profile)."

## Contributions calendar

Your contributions calendar shows your contribution activity.

### Viewing contributions from specific times

- Click on a day's square to show the contributions made during that 24-hour period.
- Press *Shift* and click on another day's square to show contributions made during that time span.

{% note %}

**Note:** You can select up to a one-month range on your contributions calendar. If you select a larger time span, we will only display one month of contributions.

{% endnote %}

### How contribution event times are calculated

Timestamps are calculated differently for commits and pull requests:
- **Commits** use the time zone information in the commit timestamp. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting commits on your timeline](/articles/troubleshooting-commits-on-your-timeline)."
- **Pull requests** and **issues** opened on {% data variables.product.product_name %} use your browser's time zone. Those opened via the API use the timestamp or time zone [specified in the API call](https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-03-04-timezone-handling-changes).

## Activity overview

{% data reusables.profile.activity-overview-summary %} For more information, see "[Showing an overview of your activity on your profile](/articles/showing-an-overview-of-your-activity-on-your-profile)."

![Activity overview section on profile](/assets/images/help/profile/activity-overview-section.png)

The organizations featured in the activity overview are prioritized according to how active you are in the organization. If you @mention an organization in your profile bio, and you’re an organization member, then that organization is prioritized first in the activity overview. For more information, see “[Mentioning people and teams](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams)” or "[Adding a bio to your profile](/articles/adding-a-bio-to-your-profile/)."

## Contribution activity

The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened. You can see your contributions over time by either clicking **Show more activity** at the bottom of your contribution activity or by clicking the year you're interested in viewing on the right side of the page. Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity. If you can't see certain events in your timeline, check to make sure you still have access to the organization or repository where the event happened.
