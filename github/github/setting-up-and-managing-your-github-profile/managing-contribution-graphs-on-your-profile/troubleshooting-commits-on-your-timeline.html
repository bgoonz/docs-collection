      On your profile page’s timeline, you can click the number of commits next
      to a specific repository to see more details about your commits from that
      time period, including a diff of specific changes made in a repository.

      If you click a commit link from your profile page and don’t see all of the
      expected commits on the repository’s commits page, then it’s possible the
      commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the
      commit date are different.

    <h2 id="how-github-uses-the-git-author-date-and-commit-date">
      How GitHub uses the Git author date and commit date
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Git, the author date is when someone first creates a commit with
      <code>git commit</code>. The commit date is identical to the author date
      unless someone changes the commit date by using
      <code>git commit --amend</code>, a force push, a rebase, or other Git
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      On your profile page, the author date is used to calculate when a commit
      was made. Whereas, in a repository, the commit date is used to calculate
      when a commit was made in the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most often, the author date and commit date are the same but you may
      notice that your commit sequence is out of order if the commit history is
      changed. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile"
        >Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?</a
      >”
    </p>
    <h2 id="viewing-missing-commit-details-from-commits-in-your-timeline">
      Viewing missing commit details from commits in your timeline
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can use the <code>git show</code> command with the
      <code>--pretty=fuller</code> flag to check if the commit author date and
      commit date are different.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ git show &lt;em&gt;Your commit SHA number&lt;/em&gt; --pretty=fuller
commit &lt;em&gt;Your commit SHA number&lt;/em&gt;
Author:     octocat &lt;em&gt;user email&lt;/em&gt;
AuthorDate: Tue Apr 03 02:02:30 2018 +0900
Commit:     Sally Johnson &lt;em&gt;user email&lt;/em&gt;
CommitDate: Tue Apr 10 06:25:08 2018 +0900</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the author and commit date are different, you can manually change the
      commit date in the URL to see the commit details.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: - This URL uses the author date of <code>2018-04-03</code>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code
        >https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&amp;since=2018-04-03T00:00:00Z&amp;until=2018-04-03T23:59:59Z</code
      >
      - This URL uses the commit date of <code>2018-04-10</code>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code
        >https://github.com/your-organization-or-personal-account/your-repository/commits?author=octocat&amp;since=2018-04-10T00:00:00Z&amp;until=2018-04-10T23:59:59Z</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open the URL with the modified commit date, you can see the
      commit details.

      If you’re not seeing expected commits on your timeline, it’s possible the
      commit history in Git was rewritten and the commit author date and the
      commit date are different. For other possibilities, see “<a
        href="/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile"
