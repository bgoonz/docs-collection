**Note:** If you have a legacy per-repository billing plan, you will still be charged for your archived repository. If you don't want to be charged for an archived repository, you must upgrade to a new product. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s products](/articles/github-s-products)."

{% endnote %}

Once a repository is archived, you cannot add or remove collaborators or teams. Contributors with access to the repository can only fork or star your project.

When a repository is archived, its issues, pull requests, code, labels, milestones, projects, wiki, releases, commits, tags, branches, reactions, code scanning alerts, and comments become read-only. To make changes in an archived repository, you must unarchive the repository first.

You can search for archived repositories. For more information, see "[Searching for repositories](/articles/searching-for-repositories/#search-based-on-whether-a-repository-is-archived)." You can also search for issues and pull requests within archived repositories. For more information, see "[Searching issues and pull requests](/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/#search-based-on-whether-a-repository-is-archived)."
