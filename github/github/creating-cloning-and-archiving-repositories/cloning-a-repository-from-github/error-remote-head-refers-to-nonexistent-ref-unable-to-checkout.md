Detecting this error is simple; Git will warn you when you try to clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git
# Clone a repo
> Cloning into 'repo'...
> remote: Counting objects: 66179, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (15587/15587), done.
> remote: Total 66179 (delta 46985), reused 65596 (delta 46402)
> Receiving objects: 100% (66179/66179), 51.66 MiB | 667 KiB/s, done.
> Resolving deltas: 100% (46985/46985), done.
> warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout.
```

To fix the error, you'll need to be an administrator of the repository on {% data variables.product.product_location %}.
You'll want to [change the default branch](/github/administering-a-repository/changing-the-default-branch) of the repository.

After that, you can get a list of all the available branches from the command line:

```shell
$ git branch -a
# Lists ALL the branches
>   remotes/origin/awesome
>   remotes/origin/more-work
>   remotes/origin/new-main
```

Then, you can just switch to your new branch:

```shell
$ git checkout new-main
# Create and checkout a tracking branch
> Branch new-main set up to track remote branch new-main from origin.
> Switched to a new branch 'new-main'
```
