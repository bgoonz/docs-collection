title: HTTPS cloning errors
intro: 'There are a few common errors when using HTTPS with Git. These errors usually indicate you have an old version of Git, or you don''t have access to the repository.'

Here's an example of an HTTPS error you might receive:

```shell
> error: The requested URL returned error: 401 while accessing
> https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack
> fatal: HTTP request failed
```

```shell
> Error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing
> https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git/info/refs
> fatal: HTTP request failed
```

```shell
> Error: https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git/info/refs not found: did you run git
> update-server-info on the server?
```

## Check your Git version

There's no minimum Git version necessary to interact with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, but we've found version 1.7.10 to be a comfortable stable version that's available on many platforms. You can always [download the latest version on the Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Ensure the remote is correct

The repository you're trying to fetch must exist on {% data variables.product.product_location %}, and the URL is case-sensitive.

You can find the URL of the local repository by opening the command line and
typing `git remote -v`:

```shell
$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/ghost/reactivecocoa.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/ghost/reactivecocoa.git (push)

$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ghost/ReactiveCocoa.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  https://github.com/ghost/ReactiveCocoa.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/ghost/ReactiveCocoa.git (push)
```

Alternatively, you can change the URL through our
[{% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}](https://desktop.github.com/) application.

## Provide an access token

To access {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you must authenticate with a personal access token instead of your password. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)."

{% data reusables.command_line.provide-an-access-token %}

## Check your permissions

When prompted for a username and password, make sure you use an account that has access to the repository.

{% tip %}

**Tip**: If you don't want to enter your credentials every time you interact with the remote repository, you can turn on [credential caching](/github/getting-started-with-github/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git). If you are already using credential caching, please make sure that your computer has the correct credentials cached. Incorrect or out of date credentials will cause authentication to fail.

{% endtip %}

## Use SSH instead

If you've previously set up SSH keys, you can use the SSH clone URL instead of HTTPS.  For more information, see "[About remote repositories](/github/getting-started-with-github/about-remote-repositories)."
