</header>
<p>You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.</p>
<p>You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository’s visibility. For more information, see “<a href="/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility">About repository visibility</a>.”</p>
<p>For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/">Permission levels for a user account repository</a>” and “<a href="/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/">Repository permission levels for an organization</a>.”</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt %} With {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for user accounts and organizations, you can work with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with a full feature set, or unlimited private repositories with a limited feature set. To get advanced tooling for private repositories, you can upgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. {% data reusables.gated-features.more-info %} {% else %} Each person and organization can own unlimited repositories and invite an unlimited number of collaborators to all repositories. {% endif %}</p>
<p>You can use repositories to manage your work and collaborate with others. - You can use issues to collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks you’d like to accomplish. For more information, see “<a href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues">About issues</a>.”{% ifversion fpt %} - {% data reusables.discussions.you-can-use-discussions %}{% endif %} - You can use pull requests to propose changes to a repository. For more information, see “<a href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>.” - You can use project boards to organize and prioritize your issues and pull requests.
