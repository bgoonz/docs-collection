## About repository templates

Anyone with read permissions to a template repository can create a repository from that template. For more information, see "[Creating a template repository](/articles/creating-a-template-repository)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}
{% tip %}

**Tip**: You can also create a repository from a template using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see "[`gh repo create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} documentation.

{% endtip %}
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}
You can choose to include the directory structure and files from only the default branch of the template repository or to include all branches. Branches created from a template have unrelated histories, which means you cannot create pull requests or merge between the branches.
{% endif %}

Creating a repository from a template is similar to forking a repository, but there are important differences:
- A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
- Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
- A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.

For more information about forks, see "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."

{% data reusables.repositories.choose-repo-visibility %}{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}
