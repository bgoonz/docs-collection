<h1 class="title">About code owners</h1>
</header>
<p>People with admin or owner permissions can set up a CODEOWNERS file in a repository.</p>
<p>The people you choose as code owners must have write permissions for the repository. When the code owner is a team, that team must have write permissions, even if all the individual members of the team already have write permissions directly, through organization membership, or through another team membership.</p>
<h2 id="about-code-owners">About code owners</h2>
<p>Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. Code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. For more information about draft pull requests, see “<a href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>.” When you mark a draft pull request as ready for review, code owners are automatically notified. If you convert a pull request to a draft, people who are already subscribed to notifications are not automatically unsubscribed. For more information, see “<a href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request">Changing the stage of a pull request</a>.”</p>
<p>When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository. For more information, see “<a href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging">About protected branches</a>.”</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}If a team has enabled code review assignments, the individual approvals won’t satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see “<a href="/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team">Managing code review assignment for your team</a>.”{% endif %}</p>
<p>{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes &gt; 2.22 %} If a file has a code owner, you can see who the code owner is before you open a pull request. In the repository, you can browse to the file and hover over {% octicon “shield-lock” aria-label=“The edit icon” %}.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/help/repository/code-owner-for-a-file.png" alt="Code owner for a file in a repository" /> {% endif %}</p>
<h2 id="codeowners-file-location">CODEOWNERS file location</h2>
<p>To use a CODEOWNERS file, create a new file called <code>CODEOWNERS</code> in the root, <code>docs/</code>, or <code>.github/</code> directory of the repository, in the branch where you’d like to add the code owners.</p>
<p>Each CODEOWNERS file assigns the code owners for a single branch in the repository. Thus, you can assign different code owners for different branches, such as <code>@octo-org/codeowners-team</code> for a code base on the default branch and <code>@octocat</code> for a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
<p>For code owners to receive review requests, the CODEOWNERS file must be on the base branch of the pull request. For example, if you assign <code>@octocat</code> as the code owner for <em>.js</em> files on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of your repository, <code>@octocat</code> will receive review requests when a pull request with changes to <em>.js</em> files is opened between the head branch and <code>gh-pages</code>.</p>
<h2 id="codeowners-syntax">CODEOWNERS syntax</h2>
<p>A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format">gitignore</a> files, with <a href="#syntax-exceptions">some exceptions</a>. The pattern is followed by one or more {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} usernames or team names using the standard <code>@username</code> or <code>@org/team-name</code> format. You can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, for example <code>user@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>If any line in your CODEOWNERS file contains invalid syntax, the file will not be detected and will not be used to request reviews. ### Example of a CODEOWNERS file</p>
<pre><code># This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They&#39;ll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.go docs@example.com

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @doctocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps` 
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github` 
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
/apps/ @octocat
/apps/github </code></pre>
<h3 id="syntax-exceptions">Syntax exceptions</h3>
<p>There are some syntax rules for gitignore files that do not work in CODEOWNERS files: - Escaping a pattern starting with <code>#</code> using <code>\</code> so it is treated as a pattern and not a comment - Using <code>!</code> to negate a pattern - Using <code>[ ]</code> to define a character range</p>
<h2 id="codeowners-and-branch-protection">CODEOWNERS and branch protection</h2>
<p>Repository owners can add branch protection rules to ensure that changed code is reviewed by the owners of the changed files. For more information, see “<a href="/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches">About protected branches</a>.”</p>
<h3 id="example-of-a-codeowners-file">Example of a CODEOWNERS file</h3>
<pre><code># In this example, any change inside the `/apps` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat.
/apps/ @doctocat

# In this example, any change inside the `/apps` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
/apps/ @doctocat @octocat

# In this example, any change inside the `/apps` directory
# will require approval from a member of the @example-org/content team.
# If a member of @example-org/content opens a pull request 
# with a change inside the `/apps` directory, their approval is implicit.
# The team is still added as a reviewer but not a required reviewer.
# Anyone can approve the changes.
/apps/ @example-org/content-team</code></pre>
