        Create a <strong>private</strong> repository to host the source code
        from your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a second repository with the permissions you desire to host the
        issue tracker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a README file to the issues repository explaining the purpose of
        this repository and linking to the issues section.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set your collaborators or teams to give access to the repositories as
        you desire.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Users with write access to both can reference and close issues back and
      forth across the repositories, but those without the required permissions
      will see references that contain a minimum of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you pushed a commit to the private repositoryâ€™s default
      branch with a message that read
      <code>Fixes organization/public-repo#12</code>, the issue would be closed,
      but only users with the proper permissions would see the cross-repository
      reference indicating the commit that closed the issue. Without the
      permissions, a reference still appears, but the details are omitted.
