        Limits for viewing content and diffs in a repository
      </h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Most of the limits below affect both {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} and the API.
    </p>
    <h2 id="text-limits">Text limits</h2>
    <p>
      Text files over <strong>1 MB</strong> are always displayed as plain text.
      Code is not syntax highlighted, and prose files are not converted to HTML
      (such as Markdown, AsciiDoc, <em>etc.</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Text files over <strong>5 MB</strong> are only available through their raw
      URLs, which are served through
      <code>{% data variables.product.raw_github_com %}</code>; for example,
      <code
        >https://{% data variables.product.raw_github_com
        %}/octocat/Spoon-Knife/master/index.html</code
      >. Click the <strong>Raw</strong> button to get the raw URL for a file.
    </p>
    <h2 id="diff-limits">Diff limits</h2>
    <p>
      Because diffs can become very large, we impose these limits on diffs for
      commits, pull requests, and compare views:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No single file’s diff may exceed
        <em>20,000 lines that you can load</em> or <em>1 MB</em> of raw diff
        data. <em>Four hundred lines</em> and <em>20 KB</em> are automatically
        loaded for a single file.
      </li>
      <li>
        The maximum number of files in a single diff is limited to <em>300</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The maximum number of renderable files (such as images, PDFs, and
        GeoJSON files) in a single diff is limited to <em>25</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some portions of a limited diff may be displayed, but anything exceeding
      the limit is not shown.
    </p>
    <h2 id="commit-listings-limits">Commit listings limits</h2>
    <p>
      The compare view and pull requests pages display a list of commits between
      the <code>base</code> and <code>head</code> revisions. These lists are
      limited to <strong>250</strong> commits. If they exceed that limit, a note
      indicates that additional commits are present (but they’re not shown).
    </p>
  </body>
