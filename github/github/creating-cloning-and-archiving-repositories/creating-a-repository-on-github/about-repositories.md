You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.

You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility. For more information, see "[About repository visibility](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility)."

For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository. For more information, see "[Permission levels for a user account repository](/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)" and "[Repository permission levels for an organization](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)."

{% ifversion fpt %}
With {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for user accounts and organizations, you can work with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with a full feature set, or unlimited private repositories with a limited feature set. To get advanced tooling for private repositories, you can upgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. {% data reusables.gated-features.more-info %}
{% else %}
Each person and organization can own unlimited repositories and invite an unlimited number of collaborators to all repositories.
{% endif %}

You can use repositories to manage your work and collaborate with others.
- You can use issues to collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks you'd like to accomplish. For more information, see "[About issues](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)."{% ifversion fpt %}
- {% data reusables.discussions.you-can-use-discussions %}{% endif %}
- You can use pull requests to propose changes to a repository. For more information, see "[About pull requests](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)."
- You can use project boards to organize and prioritize your issues and pull requests. For more information, see "[About project boards](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)."
