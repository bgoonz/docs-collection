      Customer’s Order Form. The Software includes components licensed to GitHub
      by third parties, including software whose licenses require GitHub to make
      the source code for those components available. The source code for such
      components will be provided upon request. Without limiting the foregoing,
      this license permits Customer to download and run Microsoft SQL Server
      Standard Edition container image for Linux files (“<strong
        >SQL Server Images</strong
      >”), which may be used only with the Software as documented. Customer’s
      right to use the SQL Server Images ends when Customer no longer has rights
      to use the Software, and Customer must uninstall the SQL Server Images
      when its right to use them ends. Microsoft Corporation may disable SQL
      Server Images at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. License Restrictions.</strong> Except as expressly permitted by
      law or by applicable third-party license, Customer and its Affiliates must
      not and must not allow any third party to: (i) sublicense, sell, rent,
      lease, transfer, assign, or redistribute the Software; (ii) host the
      Software for the benefit of third parties; (iii) disclose or permit any
      third party to access the Software, except as expressly permitted in
      Section 2; (iv) hack or modify the License Key, or avoid or change any
      license registration process; (v) except for Customer Modifications,
      modify or create derivative works of the Software, or merge the Software
      with other software; (vi) disassemble, decompile, bypass any code
      obfuscation, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to
      derive any of its source code, in whole or in part; (vii) modify, obscure,
      or delete any proprietary rights notices included in or on the Software or
      Documentation; or (viii) otherwise use or copy the Software or
      Documentation in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Intellectual Property Rights.</strong> As between the Parties,
      GitHub owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual
      property rights, in and to the Products. GitHub reserves all rights in and
      to the Products not expressly granted to Customer under this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5. Feedback.</strong> Customer may provide Feedback to GitHub
      regarding the Products. Feedback is voluntary and is not Customer
      Confidential Information, even if designated as such. GitHub may fully
      exercise and exploit such Feedback for the purpose of (i) improving the
      operation, functionality and use of GitHub’s existing and future product
      offerings and commercializing such offerings; and (ii) publishing
      aggregated statistics about the quality of the Products, provided that no
      data in any such publication will be used to specifically identify
      Customer, its employees or Customer’s proprietary software code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. Subscription Licenses.</strong> Subscription Licenses are
      granted on a per User basis and multiple Users may not use the same
      Subscription License. Customer may reassign a Subscription License to a
      new User only after ninety (90) days from the last reassignment of that
      same Subscription License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent
      hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the User’s employment or
      contract, or (iii) temporary reallocation of Subscription Licenses to
      cover a User’s absence. When Customer reassigns a Subscription License
      from one User to another, Customer must block the former User’s access to
      the Subscription License.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. Affiliates.</strong> Customer’s Affiliates are authorized to
      use the Software in accordance with this Agreement, so long as Customer
      remains fully responsible for their access and use of the Software.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8. Payment</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.1</strong> <em>Fees.</em> Customer agrees to pay the Fees in
      full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars.
      Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice
      date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as
      provided in Sections 13 and 14.1. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on
      time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at
      law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per
      month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and
      to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable
      Order Form or SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees,
      duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub’s
      net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
      Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.2</strong>
      <em>Purchasing Additional Subscription Licenses.</em> Customer may obtain
      additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement by submitting a
      request through GitHub’s website or via its sales team. A new Order Form
      will then be generated and if Customer purchases the additional
      Subscription Licenses, Customer must pay the then-currently applicable
      Fees for them, prorated for the balance of the applicable Subscription
      Term. Upon renewal of Customer’s Subscription Licenses for another
      Subscription Term, GitHub will invoice all Subscription Licenses at once
      on an annual basis unless otherwise specified in an Order Form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.3</strong> <em>Add-On Software.</em> Add-On Software is licensed
      on a per User basis. For the avoidance of doubt, and unless otherwise set
      forth in an Order Form, the number of Subscription Licenses Customer has
      at any given time for Add-On Software must equal the number of
      Subscription Licenses Customer has for the Products under this Agreement.
      For example, if Customer wishes to purchase a subscription to Advanced
      Security and already holds Subscription Licenses for 100 Users for the
      Products, it must purchase Subscription Licenses for 100 Users for
      Advanced Security.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>9. Delivery.</strong> GitHub will make the License Key available
      for Customer to download on a secure, password-protected website. All
      deliveries under this Section 9 will be electronic. For the avoidance of
      doubt, Customer is responsible for installation of any Software and
      acknowledge that GitHub has no further delivery obligation with respect to
      the Software after delivery of the License Key. As Updates become
      available, GitHub will make those available for download on the same
      website. Customer must Update the Software on a commercially reasonable
      basis but no less than one (1) time per year. Customer is responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of Customer’s usernames and passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10. Verification.</strong> At GitHub’s request, Customer will
      promptly provide GitHub with a Software-generated report verifying that
      Customer is using the Software in accordance with this Agreement. GitHub
      will invoice Customer for any additional use, effective from the date its
      use first exceeded the terms of the Agreement.
    </p>
    <p><strong>11. Support.</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.1</strong> <em>Standard Support.</em> GitHub will provide
      standard technical Support for the Software at no additional charge
      twenty-four (24) hours per day, five (5) days per week, excluding weekends
      and national U.S. holidays. Standard Support is only offered via web-based
      ticketing through GitHub Support, and Support requests must be initiated
      from a User with which GitHub’s Support team can interact. GitHub may
      provide premium Support (subject to the
      <a
        href="/enterprise/admin/enterprise-support/about-github-premium-support-for-github-enterprise-server"
        >Premium Support for Enterprise Server terms</a
      >) or dedicated technical Support for the Software at the Support level,
      Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an Order Form or SOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.2</strong> <em>Enhanced Support Offerings.</em> GitHub may
      provide enhanced Support offerings for the Software (including the
      Premium, Premium Plus, and Engineering Direct Support offerings) in
      accordance with the
      <a
        href="/enterprise/admin/enterprise-support/about-github-premium-support-for-github-enterprise"
        >Support terms</a
      >, and at the Support level, Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an
      Order Form or SOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.3</strong> <em>Exclusions.</em> GitHub will use reasonable
      efforts to correct any material, reproducible errors in the Software of
      which Customer notifies GitHub. However, GitHub will not be responsible
      for providing Support where (i) someone (other than GitHub) modifies the
      Software; (ii) Customer changes its operating system or environment in a
      way that adversely affects the Software or its performance; (iii) Customer
      uses the Software in a manner other than as authorized under this
      Agreement or the Documentation; or (iv) there is negligence or misuse by
      Customer of the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.4</strong> <em>Updates; Releases.</em> GitHub will only Support
      a given Release of the Software for one (1) year from the original Release
      date, or six (6) months from the last Update of the Release, whichever is
      longer. If Customer requires Support for earlier Releases of the Software,
      then Customer must pay for that Support in accordance with the terms of a
      mutually agreed upon Order Form or SOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12. Professional Services.</strong> Upon Customer’s request for
      Professional Services, GitHub will provide an SOW detailing such
      Professional Services. GitHub will perform the Professional Services
      described in each SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which
      the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to
      determine personnel assigned. GitHub may use third parties to perform the
      Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains responsible for their
      acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub retains
      all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in
      connection with performing the Professional Services, including software,
      tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques,
      and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer while
      performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to Customer a
      non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term
      license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement,
      solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>13.1</strong> <em>Limited Software Warranties</em>. GitHub
      warrants that: (i) the unmodified Software, at the time it is made
      available to Customer for download, will not contain or transmit any
      malware, viruses, or worms (otherwise known as computer code or other
      technology specifically designed to disrupt, disable, or harm Customer’s
      software, hardware, computer system, or network) and (ii) for ninety (90)
      days from the date it is made available for initial download, the
      unmodified Software will substantially conform to its Documentation.
      GitHub does not warrant that Customer’s use of the Software will be
      uninterrupted, or that the operation of the Software will be error-free.
      The warranty in this Section 13.1 will not apply if Customer modifies or
      uses the Software in any way that is not expressly permitted by this
      Agreement and the Documentation. GitHub’s only obligation, and Customer’s
      only remedy, for any breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub’s option
      and expense, to either (a) repair the Software; (b) replace the Software;
      or (c) terminate this Agreement with respect to the defective Software,
      and refund the unused, prepaid Fees for the defective Software during the
      then-current Subscription Term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13.2</strong> <em>Professional Services Warranty.</em> GitHub
      warrants to Customer that any Professional Services performed under this
      Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by
      appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub’s only obligation, and
      Customer’s only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub’s
      option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional
      Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be
      cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused, prepaid Fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13.3</strong> <em>General Warranty.</em> Each Party represents and
      warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this
      Agreement, and that this Agreement and each Order Form is entered into by
      an employee or agent of such Party with all necessary authority to bind
      such Party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13.4</strong> <em>Beta Previews.</em> Customer may choose to use
      Beta Previews in its sole discretion. Beta Previews may not be supported
      and may be changed at any time without notice. Beta Previews may not be as
      reliable or available as the Software. Beta Previews are not subject to
      the same security measures to which the Software has been and is subject.
      GitHub will have no liability arising out of or in connection with Beta
      Previews. <strong>CUSTOMER USERS BETA PREVIEWS AT ITS OWN RISK.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13.5</strong> <em>Warranty Disclaimer.</em> THE LIMITED WARRANTIES
      DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES GITHUB MAKES WITH RESPECT TO THE
      SOFTWARE, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND SUPPORT. GITHUB DOES NOT MAKE ANY
      OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, AND HEREBY SPECIFICALLY
      DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
      INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
      ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NO ADVICE OR
      INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, PROVIDED BY GITHUB OR ANYWHERE ELSE
      WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
      AGREEMENT.
    </p>
    <p><strong>14. Defense of Claims; Release.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Parties will defend each other against third-party claims, as and to
      the extent set forth in this Section 14 and will pay the amount of any
      resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the
      defending Party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the
      right to control the defense and any settlement of it. The Party being
      defended must provide the defending Party with all requested assistance,
      information, and authority. The defending Party will reimburse the other
      Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in providing
      assistance, and will not settle or make any admissions with respect to a
      third-party claim without the other Party’s prior written consent, not to
      be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This Section 14 describes the
      Parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims.

      WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND
      WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
      DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.2</strong> <em>Limitation of Total Liability</em>. TO THE
      MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER
      PARTY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FROM ALL CAUSES OF

      PAID TO GITHUB DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING
      RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED FREE
      OF CHARGE, GITHUB’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO $5,000.00
      USD. FOR BETA PREVIEWS, GITHUB’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.3</strong> <em>Exceptions</em>. The exclusions and limitations

    </p>
    <p><strong>16. Confidentiality.</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.1</strong> <em>Definition of Confidential Information</em>. For
      the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any
      business or technical information that either Party discloses to the
      other, in writing, orally, or by any other means, including disclosures
      like computer programs, code, algorithms, data, know-how, formulas,
      processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics and
      other technical, business, financial, and product development plans, names
      and expertise of employees and consultants, and customer lists. For the
      purposes of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in Section 2.1,
      the source code of the Software will be deemed to be GitHub’s Confidential
      Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.2</strong> <em>Restrictions on Use and Disclosure.</em> Neither
      Party will use the other Party’s Confidential Information, except as
      permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in
      confidence and protect the other Party’s Confidential Information using at
      least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a
      similar nature, but in all events at least a reasonable degree of care.
      Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any
      unauthorized disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information,
      including, without limitation, disclosing Confidential Information only to
      its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and
      financial advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) (i) with a need to
      know such information, (ii) who are parties to appropriate agreements
      sufficient to comply with this Section 16, and (iii) who are informed of
      the non-disclosure obligations imposed by this Section 16. Each Party is
      responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The
      foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing
      Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or
      requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body,
      provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives
      reasonable notice to the other Party to enable them to contest such order
      or requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section 16 will survive
      the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.3</strong> <em>Exclusions</em>. The restrictions set forth in
      Section 16.2 will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information
      that: (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving
      party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the
      receiving party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a
      source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it;
      (iii) is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without
      restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized
      officer of such disclosing party; or (iv) the receiving party
      independently develops without access to or use of the other Party’s
      Confidential Information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>17. Term and Termination.</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>17.1</strong> <em>Agreement</em> <em>Term</em>. This Agreement
      starts on the Agreement Effective Date and will continue in effect until
      this Agreement is terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section
      17. If this Agreement is terminated before the expiration or termination
      of a Subscription Term, then any active Order Forms will remain in force
      pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>17.2</strong> <em>Termination for Convenience</em>. Either Party
      may terminate an Order Form, with or without cause, upon at least thirty
      (30) days written notice before the end of the then-current Subscription
      Term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>17.3</strong> <em>Termination for Material Breach</em>. Either
      Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the other
      Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to
      cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives
      notification. Either Party reserves the right to terminate this Agreement
      immediately upon written notice, but without giving the other Party a cure
      period, if Customer breaches any of the terms of this Agreement relating
      to GitHub’s intellectual property (including Customer’s compliance with
      the license grant and any license restrictions) or either Party’s
      Confidential Information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>17.4</strong> <em>Effect of Termination; Survival.</em> When this
      Agreement terminates or expires, Customer may not execute additional Order
      Forms; however, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect for the
      remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or
      expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the Subscription Term for any Software
      will immediately end; (ii) Customer will no longer have the right to use
      the Software, and any Subscription Licenses granted in the Order Form will
      automatically cease to exist as of the date of termination or expiration;
      (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to termination, Customer must pay those
      Fees immediately; (iv) Customer must destroy all copies of the Software in
      its possession or control, and certify in writing to GitHub that it has
      done so; and (v) each Party will promptly return to the other (or, if the
      other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging
      to the other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may continue to
      access the Software to migrate its data for ninety (90) days after
      termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however,
      Customer must not use the Software on a production basis during that time.
      Any terms or sections which by their nature should reasonably survive will
      survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form.

        Lab for Enterprise Server.</em
      >
      If Customer’s planned use of GitHub Insights or Learning Lab for
      Enterprise Server involves processing personal data, Customer is solely

      action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought
      exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern

      legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought
      exclusively in the courts located in Dublin, and the Parties hereby
      consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. The Parties expressly
      agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the

      Transactions Act will not apply to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, GitHub may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with
      proper jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>18.4</strong> <em>Government Users.</em> The Products and

      Documentation” as described in Federal Acquisition Regulations 12.212 and
      27.405-3, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
      227.7202-3. The Products are licensed to the United States Government end
      user as restricted computer software and limited rights data. No technical
      data or computer software is developed under this Agreement. Any use,
      disclosure, modification, distribution, or reproduction of the Products or
      Documentation by the United States Government or its contractors is
      subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. All other use is
      prohibited.

      restrictions by certain foreign governments, and Customer will comply with
      all applicable export and import laws and regulations in Customer’s use of
      the Products. Customer must not, and must not allow any third party to,
      remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export

      entities, or anyone subject to other applicable prohibited or sanctioned
      persons lists; (iii) to any country or territory to which such export or
      re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government
      or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental
      approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such
      license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export,
      sanctions, or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United
      States or foreign agency or authority. Customer represents and warrants
      that Customer is not located in under the control of, or a national or
      resident of any such prohibited country or territory or on any such
      prohibited party list. GitHub Enterprise Server is a self-hosted virtual
      appliance that can be run within Customer’s own datacenter or virtual
      private cloud. As such, GitHub Enterprise Server can be used to store ITAR
      or other export-controlled information. However, Customer is responsible
      for ensuring such compliance. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the
      Products are restricted from being used for the design or development of
