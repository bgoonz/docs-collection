    <h2 id="privacy">5. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      5.1 As part of the development and evaluation of our evaluation programs,
      GitHub needs to collect information about how Customer uses services and
      programs and how GitHub can improve them. GitHub may collect certain
      additional personal information from Customer. For example, GitHub may
      invite Customer to provide Feedback (as explained in Section 6 below).
      GitHub might ask questions about Customer’s  experiences, familiarity with
      the product, or demographic information. GitHub uses this information to
      improve its products and services and does not sell Feedback to third
      parties or advertisers. Customer may decline to provide Feedback, decline
      to answer specific questions, or contact GitHub to delete or alter the
      information it has collected about Customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2 GitHub’s servers are located in the United States. GitHub processes
      Customer’s data in the United States. However, Customer is responsible for
      determining what personal data it submits to GitHub. Please see the
      <a href="/articles/github-privacy-statement">Privacy Statement</a> for
      more information.
    </p>
    <h2 id="feedback">6. Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is always trying to improve its products and services, and
      Customer’s Feedback about its evaluation account will help do that. If
      Customer chooses to provide GitHub with any Feedback, Customer
      acknowledges and agrees that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully
      paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and
      perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or
      incorporate the Feedback into GitHub products, services, and
      documentation.

    <h2 id="amendments-waivers-no-third-party-beneficiaries">
      7. Amendments; Waivers; No Third-Party Beneficiaries
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Evaluation Agreement may not be changed, except by a writing signed
      by both parties or by an update to the Generally Applicable Terms. If any
      term, condition, or provision in this Evaluation Agreement is found to be
      invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid
      and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. The parties
      expressly agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries to this
      Evaluation Agreement.

    <h2 id="entire-agreement-order-of-precedence">
      8. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Generally Applicable Terms together with this Evaluation Agreement
      contain the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject
      matter and supersede all prior communications, representations,
      understandings and agreements, whether written or oral. The terms or
      conditions of any of Customer’s purchase orders, acknowledgements, or
      other documents sent to GitHub in connection with this Evaluation
      Agreement will be null and void, and of no effect. In the event of a
      conflict between this Evaluation Agreement and the Generally Applicable
