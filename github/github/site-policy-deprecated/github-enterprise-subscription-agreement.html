      If Customer has purchased any Products from an authorized GitHub reseller,
      the following Sections of this Agreement are superseded by the terms
      Customer has agreed upon with the GitHub reseller: Section 1.1 (Term and
      Termination); 1.2 (Payment); Section 2.3 (Delivery); and Section 2.4
      (Verification).
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-1-general-terms-and-conditions">
      SECTION 1: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Section 1 sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to
      Customer’s purchase and use of any of the Products. Capitalized terms used
      but not defined in the body of this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.
    </p>
    <h3 id="term-and-termination.">1.1 Term and Termination.</h3>
    <h4 id="term.">1.1.1 Term.</h4>
    <p>
      This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and will continue in effect
      until terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section 1.1.
    </p>
    <h4 id="termination-for-convenience.-account-cancellation.">
      1.1.2 Termination for Convenience. Account Cancellation.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Either Party may terminate an Order Form or this Agreement, without cause,
      upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice before the end of the
      then-current Subscription Term. If Customer elects to terminate an Order
      Form or Agreement, it is Customer’s responsibility to properly cancel its
      account with GitHub by going into Settings in the global navigation bar at
      the top of the screen. GitHub cannot cancel accounts in response to an
      email or phone request.
    </p>
    <h4 id="termination-for-material-breach.">
      1.1.3 Termination for Material Breach.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the
      other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails
      to cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives
      notification. Each Party also reserves the right to terminate this
      Agreement immediately upon written notice, without giving the other Party
      a cure period, as follows: by GitHub, if Customer breaches any of the
      terms of this Agreement relating to GitHub’s intellectual property
      (including Customer’s non-compliance with the license grant or any license
      restrictions), or if Customer’s account has been suspended for more than
      ninety (90) days; or by either Party, if the other breaches its
      confidentiality obligations in Section 1.4.
    </p>
    <h4 id="effect-of-termination-survival.">
      1.1.4 Effect of Termination; Survival.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer may not execute additional
      Order Forms; however, this Agreement will remain in effect for the
      remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or
      expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the Subscription Term for the Software
      and/or Service will immediately end; (ii) any Subscription Licenses in the
      Order Form will automatically terminate, and Customer will no longer have
      the right to use the Products; (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to
      termination, Customer must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) Customer must
      destroy all copies of the Software in Customer’s possession or control,
      and certify in writing to GitHub that Customer has done so; and (v) each
      Party will promptly return (or, if the other party requests it, destroy)
      all Confidential Information belonging to the other to the extent
      permitted by the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may
      continue to access the Software to migrate Customer’s data and may request
      migration of the data in its repositories for up to ninety (90) days after
      termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however,
      Customer may not use the Software or Service on a production basis during
      that time. Any provisions which by their nature should reasonably survive
      will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order
      Form.
    </p>
    <h3 id="payment.">1.2 Payment.</h3>
    <h4 id="fees.">1.2.1 Fees.</h4>
    <p>
      Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or
      setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. Customer must pay the Fees within
      thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this
      Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections 1.5.1 and
      1.6.2. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the
      right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i)
      charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest
      interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all
      expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW.
      Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and
      governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub’s net income)
      that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h4 id="purchasing-additional-subscription-licenses.">
      1.2.2 Purchasing Additional Subscription Licenses.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Customer may obtain additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement
      by submitting a request through GitHub’s website or via its sales team. If
      Customer purchases the additional Subscription Licenses, Customer must pay
      the then-currently applicable Fees for them, prorated for the balance of
      the applicable Subscription Term. Upon renewal of Customer’s Subscription
      Licenses for another Subscription Term, GitHub will invoice all
      Subscription Licenses at once on an annual basis unless otherwise
      specified in an Order Form.
    </p>
    <h4 id="add-on-software.">1.2.3 Add-On Software.</h4>
    <p>
      Add-On Software is licensed on a per User basis. For the avoidance of
      doubt, and unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, the number of
      Subscription Licenses Customer has at any given time for Add-On Software
      must equal the number of Subscription Licenses Customer has for the
      Products under this Agreement. For example, if Customer wishes to purchase
      a subscription to Advanced Security and already holds Subscription
      Licenses for 100 Users for the Products, it must purchase Subscription
      Licenses for 100 Users for Advanced Security.
    </p>
    <h3 id="professional-services.">1.3 Professional Services.</h3>
    <p>
      Upon Customer’s request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide an
      SOW detailing such Professional Services. GitHub will perform the
      Professional Services described in each SOW. GitHub will control the
      manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and
      reserves the right to determine personnel assigned. GitHub may use third
      parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains
      responsible for their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges and agrees
      that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used
      or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services,
      including software, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions,
      processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers
      anything to Customer while performing the Professional Services, GitHub
      grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
      royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the
      term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the
      Software or Service.
    </p>
    <h3 id="confidentiality.">1.4 Confidentiality.</h3>
    <p>
      Neither Party will use the other Party’s Confidential Information, except
      as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in
      confidence and protect the other Party’s Confidential Information using at
      least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a
      similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care.
      Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any
      unauthorized disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information,
      including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information
      only to its Representatives who (i) have a need to know such information,
      (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this
      Section 1.4, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and
      disclosure set forth in this Section 1.4. Each Party is responsible for
      all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations
      will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of
      the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court,
      administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the Party
      required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other
      Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement, unless
      such notice is prohibited by law. The restrictions set forth in this
      Section 1.4 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h3 id="defense-of-claims.">1.5 Defense of Claims.</h3>
    <p>
      The Parties will defend each other against third-party claims, as and to
      the extent set forth in this Section 1.5 and will pay the amount of any
      resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the
      defending Party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the
      right to control the defense and any settlement of it. The Party being
      defended must provide the defending Party with all requested assistance,
      information, and authority. The defending Party will reimburse the other
      Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in providing
      assistance, and will not settle or make any admissions with respect to a
      third-party claim without the other Party’s prior written consent, not to
      be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This Section 1.5 describes the
      Parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims.
    </p>
    <h4 id="github.">1.5.1 GitHub.</h4>
    <p>
      GitHub will defend Customer against any claim brought by an unaffiliated
      third party to the extent it alleges Customer’s authorized use of the
      Software or Service infringes a copyright, patent, or trademark or
      misappropriates a trade secret of an unaffiliated third party. If GitHub
      is unable to resolve any such claim under commercially reasonable terms,
      it may, at its option, either: (i) modify, repair, or replace the Software
      or Service (as applicable); or (ii) terminate Customer’s subscription and
      refund any prepaid, unused subscription fees. GitHub will have no
      obligation under this Section 1.5.1 for any such claim arising from: (a)
      the modification of the Software or Service, or the combination,
      operation, or use of the Software or Service with equipment, devices,
      software, systems, or data, other than as expressly authorized by this
      Agreement (including the Documentation); (b) Customer’s failure to stop
      using the Software or Service after receiving notice to do so; (c)
      Customer’s obligations under Section 1.5.2; (d) products or services
      (including use of the Software or Service) that are provided by GitHub
      free of charge; or (e) access or use of Beta Previews. For purposes of
      GitHub’s obligation under this Section 1.5.1, the Software and the Service
      include open source components incorporated by GitHub therein.
    </p>
    <h4 id="customer.">1.5.2 Customer.</h4>
    <p>
      Customer will defend GitHub against any claim brought by an unaffiliated
      third party arising from: (i) Customer Content that Customer uploads to
      the Software or the Service; (ii) Customer’s violation of this Agreement,
      including Customer’s breach of confidentiality or violation of GitHub’s
      acceptable use terms; (iii) Customer Modifications to the Software; or
      (iv) any third party-branded equipment, devices, software, systems, or
      data that Customer combines, operates, or uses with the Software or
      Service.

      1.6 Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer; Limitations of Liability.
    </h3>
    <h4 id="general-warranty.">1.6.1 General Warranty.</h4>
    <p>
      Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it has the legal
      power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement
      and each Order Form and SOW is entered into by an employee or agent of
      such Party with all necessary authority to bind such Party to the terms
      and conditions of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h4 id="limited-warranties.">1.6.2 Limited Warranties.</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>(i) Software.</strong> GitHub warrants that: (1) the unmodified
      Software, at the time it is made available to Customer for download, will
      not contain or transmit any malware, viruses, or worms (otherwise known as
      computer code or other technology specifically designed to disrupt,
      disable, or harm Customer’s software, hardware, computer system, or
      network); and (2) for ninety (90) days from the date it is made available
      for initial download, the unmodified Software will substantially conform
      to its Documentation. GitHub does not warrant that Customer’s use of the
      Software will be uninterrupted, or that the operation of the Software will
      be error-free. The warranty in this Section 1.6.2(i) will not apply if
      Customer modifies or uses the Software in any way that is not expressly
      permitted by Section 2 and the Documentation. GitHub’s only obligation,
      and Customer’s only remedy, for any breach of this warranty will be, at
      GitHub’s option and expense, to either (a) repair the Software; (b)
      replace the Software; or (c) terminate this Agreement with respect to the
      defective Software, and refund the unused, prepaid Fees for the defective
      Software during the then-current Subscription Term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(ii) Professional Services.</strong> GitHub warrants to Customer
      that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be
      performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately
      qualified personnel. GitHub’s only obligation, and Customer’s only remedy,
      for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub’s option and expense, to
      either: (1) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to
      meet this warranty; or (2) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the
      SOW and refund the unused, prepaid Fees.
    </p>
    <h4 id="disclaimer.">1.6.3 Disclaimer.</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>(i) Generally.</strong> Except as expressly provided in this
      Agreement, GitHub does not make any other warranties and representation of
      any kind, and hereby specifically disclaims any other warranties, whether
      express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or
      any warranties or conditions arising out of course of dealing or usage of
      trade. No advice or information, whether oral or written, provided by
      GitHub or anywhere else will create any warranty or condition not
      expressly stated in this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(ii) Service.</strong> GitHub provides the Service
      <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong> without
      warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, GitHub expressly disclaims
      all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the
      Service, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability,
      fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and
      non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet
      Customer’s requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely,
      secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service
      is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be
      corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or
      location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful
      components. GitHub will not be responsible for any risk of loss resulting
      from Customer’s downloading and/or use of files, information, Content or
      other material obtained from the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(iii) Beta Previews.</strong> Customer may choose to use Beta
      Previews in its sole discretion. Beta Previews may not be supported and
      may be changed at any time without notice. Beta Previews may not be as
      reliable or available as the Service. Beta Previews are not subject to the
      same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is
      subject. GitHub will have no liability arising out of or in connection
      with Beta Previews.
      <strong>Customer uses Beta Previews at its own risk.</strong>

    <h4 id="limitations-of-liability.">1.6.4 Limitations of Liability.</h4>
    <p>
      <strong
        >(i) Indirect Damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
        law, in no event will either party be liable to the other party or to
        any third party for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or
        consequential damages (including for loss of profits, revenue, or data)
        or for the cost of obtaining substitute products arising out of or in
        connection with this Agreement, however caused, whether such liability
        arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (including
        negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not a party
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >(ii) Limitation of Total Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by
        applicable law, in no event will either party’s total cumulative
        liability under this Agreement from all causes of action and all
        theories of liability exceed the Fees Customer has actually paid to
        GitHub during the 12 months preceding the claim giving rise to such
        liability. For products and services (including use of the Products)
        that are provided free of charge, GitHub’s liability is limited to
        direct damages up to $5,000.00 USD. For Beta Previews, GitHub’s
        liability is limited to direct damages up to $500.00 USD.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >(iii) Exceptions. The exclusions and limitations set forth in this
        Section 1.6.4 will not apply to liability arising out of (1) a Party’s
        breach of its confidentiality obligations in Section 1.4 (except for all
        liability related to Content (excluding GitHub Content), which will
        remain subject to the limitations and exclusions above); (2) a Party’s
        defense obligations in Section 1.5; or (3) Customer’s non-compliance
        with the license grant or license restrictions in Sections 2.1 and
        2.2.</strong

    </p>
    <h3 id="subscription-licenses.">1.7 Subscription Licenses.</h3>
    <p>
      Subscription Licenses are granted on a per User basis and multiple Users
      may not use the same Subscription License. Customer may reassign a
      Subscription License to a new User only after ninety (90) days from the
      last reassignment of that same Subscription License, unless the
      reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii)
      termination of the User’s employment or contract, or (iii) temporary
      reallocation of Subscription Licenses to cover a User’s absence. When
      Customer reassigns a Subscription License from one User to another,
      Customer must block the former User’s access to the Subscription License
      and Customer’s Organizations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="affiliates.">1.8 Affiliates.</h3>
    <p>
      Customer’s Affiliates are authorized to use the Software and Service in
      accordance with this Agreement, so long as Customer remains fully
      responsible for their access and use of the Software and Service.
    </p>
    <h3 id="support.">1.9 Support.</h3>
    <p>GitHub will provide Support for the Software and Service as follows:</p>

      Service at no additional charge twenty-four (24) hours per day, five (5)
      days per week, excluding weekends and national U.S. holidays. Standard

      and Support requests must be initiated from a User with which GitHub’s
      Support team can interact.
    </p>
    <h4 id="enhanced-support-offerings.">1.9.2 Enhanced Support Offerings.</h4>
    <p>
      GitHub may provide enhanced Support offerings for the Software and Service
      (including the Premium, Premium Plus, and Engineering Direct Support
      offerings) in accordance with the

        >Support terms</a
      >, and at the Support level, Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an
      Order Form or SOW.
    </p>
    <h4 id="exclusions.">1.9.3 Exclusions.</h4>
    <p>
      GitHub will use reasonable efforts to correct any material, reproducible
      errors in the Software of which Customer notifies GitHub. However, GitHub
      will not be responsible for providing Support where (i) someone (other
      than GitHub) modifies the Software; (ii) Customer changes its operating
      system or environment in a way that adversely affects the Software or its
      performance; (iii) Customer uses the Software in a manner other than as
      authorized under this Agreement or the Documentation; or (iv) there is
      negligence or misuse by Customer of the Software.

    <h3 id="intellectual-property-rights.">
      1.10 Intellectual Property Rights.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As between the Parties, GitHub owns all right, title and interest,
      including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products. GitHub
      reserves all rights in and to the Products not expressly granted to
      Customer under this Agreement. GitHub may use, modify, and incorporate
      into its Products, any Feedback, comments, or suggestions that Customer
      may provide or post in forums without any obligation to Customer.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feedback.">1.11 Feedback.</h3>
    <p>
      Customer may provide Feedback to GitHub regarding the Products. Feedback

    <p>
      GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
      royalty-free, limited-term license to install and use the Software for
      Customer’s internal business purposes during the applicable Subscription
      Term, in accordance with the Documentation, and only for the number of
      Subscription Licenses stated in Customer’s Order Form. The Software
      includes components licensed to GitHub by third parties, including
      software whose licenses require GitHub to make the source code for those
      components available. The source code for such components will be provided
      upon request. Without limiting the foregoing, this license permits
      Customer to download and run Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition
      container image for Linux files (“<strong>SQL Server Images</strong>”),
      which may be used only with the Software as documented. Customer’s right
      to use the SQL Server Images ends when Customer no longer has rights to
      use the Software, and Customer must uninstall the SQL Server Images when
      its right to use them ends. Microsoft Corporation may disable SQL Server
      Images at any time.

      the Software; (ii) host the Software for the benefit of third parties;
      (iii) disclose or permit any third party to access the Software, except as
      expressly permitted in this Section 2; (iv) hack or modify the License
      Key, or avoid or change any license registration process; (v) except for
      Customer Modifications, modify or create derivative works of the Software,
      or merge the Software with other software; (vi) disassemble, decompile,
      bypass any code obfuscation, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or
      attempt to derive any of its source code, in whole or in part; (vii)
      modify, obscure, or delete any proprietary rights notices included in or
      on the Software or Documentation; or (viii) otherwise use or copy the
      Software or Documentation in a manner not expressly permitted by this
      Agreement.
    </p>
    <h3 id="delivery.">2.3 Delivery.</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub will make the License Key available for Customer to download on a
      secure, password-protected website. All deliveries under this Section 2
      will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer is responsible
      for installation of any Software and acknowledge that GitHub has no
      further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of
      the License Key. As Updates become available, GitHub will make those
      available for download on the same website. Customer must Update the
      Software on a commercially reasonable basis but no less than one (1) time
      per year. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
      Customer’s usernames and passwords.

    <h3 id="verification.">2.4 Verification.</h3>
    <p>
      At GitHub’s request, Customer will promptly provide GitHub with a
      Software-generated report verifying that Customer is using the Software in
      accordance with this Agreement. GitHub will invoice Customer for any
      additional use, effective from the date its use first exceeded the terms
      of the Agreement.

    <h4 id="supported-releases.">2.5.2 Supported Releases.</h4>
    <p>
      GitHub will only Support a given Release of the Software for one (1) year
      from the original Release date, or six (6) months from the last Update of
      the Release, whichever is longer. If Customer requires Support for earlier
      Releases of the Software, then Customer must pay for that Support in
      accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon Order Form or SOW.

      User(s) are located in a country outside the United States, that country’s
      minimum age may be older; in such a case, Customer is responsible for
      complying with that country’s laws.

      publishes, or submits to any part of the Service, including the rights of

    <p>
      Customer may choose to enable additional access to its Private
      Repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or
      features that require additional rights to Customer Content in Private
      Repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature,
      but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in Customer’s Private
      Repositories as Customer’s Confidential Information. If those services or
      features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the
      Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.
