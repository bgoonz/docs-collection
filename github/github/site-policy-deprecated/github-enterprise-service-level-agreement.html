      <strong>Short version:</strong> GitHub guarantees a 99.9% quarterly uptime
      commitment for the applicable GitHub service (the “<strong
        >Service Level</strong
      >” or “<strong>SLA</strong>”). If GitHub does not meet the SLA, then
      Customer will be entitled to a service credit to Customer’s account
      (“<strong>Service Credits</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      For definitions of each Service feature (“<strong>Service Feature</strong
      >”) and to review historical and current Uptime, visit the
      <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">GitHub Status Page</a>.
      Capitalized terms used but not defined in this SLA have the meaning
      assigned in Customer’s applicable agreement.

    <h2 id="uptime-guarantee">Uptime Guarantee</h2>
    <p>
      “<strong>Uptime</strong>” is the percentage of total possible minutes the
      applicable GitHub service was available in a given calendar quarter.
      GitHub commits to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime for the applicable GitHub
      service. The Uptime calculation for each Service Feature that may be
      included with the applicable GitHub service is described below (“<strong
        >Uptime Calculation</strong
      >”). If GitHub does not meet the SLA, Customer will be entitled to Service
      Credits based on the calculation below (“<strong
        >Service Credits Calculation</strong
      >”). Note, Downtime does not affect every customer at the same time or in
      the same way.

    minutes in a calendar quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in a calendar
    quarter | “<strong>Downtime</strong>” is a period of time where either (a)
    the error rate exceeds five percent (5%) in a given minute for any Service
    Feature or (b) the Service was unavailable as determined by a combination of
    GitHub’s internal and external monitoring systems. | A Service Credits claim
    may be based on either (not both) of the following calculations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        10% of the amount Customer paid for a Service Feature in a calendar
        quarter where the Uptime for that Service Feature was less than or equal
        to 99.9%, but greater than 99.0%. <br /><br />OR <br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        25% of the amount Customer paid for a Service Feature in a calendar
        quarter where the Uptime of that Service Feature was less than 99.0%.

      Executions) / (Total Triggered Executions) x 100 | “<strong
        >Total Triggered Executions</strong
      >” is the total number of all Actions executions triggered by Customer in
      a calendar quarter. <br /><br />
      “<strong>Unavailable Executions</strong>” is the total number of
      executions within Total Triggered Executions which failed to run in a
      calendar quarter. An execution failed to run when the Actions history log
      did not capture any output five (5) minutes after the trigger was
      successfully fired. | Same as above | | <strong>Packages</strong> |
      Transfers Uptime = same as Actions <br />
      <br />
      Storage Uptime = 100% - Average Error Rate* <br />
      <br />
      *The Uptime Calculation excludes public usage and storage transactions
      that do not count toward either Total Storage Transactions or Failed
      Storage Transactions (including pre-authentication failures;
      authentication failures; attempted transactions for storage accounts over
      their prescribed quotas). | “<strong>Error Rate</strong>” is the total
      number of Failed Storage Transactions divided by the Total Storage
      Transactions during a set time interval (currently set at one hour). If
      the Total Storage Transactions in a given one-hour interval is zero, the
      error rate for that interval is 0%. <br /><br />
      “<strong>Average Error Rate</strong>” is the sum of Error Rates for each
      hour in a calendar quarter divided by the total number of hours in a
      calendar quarter. | Same as above |
    </p>
    <h2 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h2>
    <p>
      Excluded from the Uptime Calculation are Service Feature failures
      resulting from (i) Customer’s acts, omissions, or misuse of the applicable
      GitHub service including violations of the Agreement; (ii) failure of
      Customer’s internet connectivity; (iii) factors outside GitHub’s
      reasonable control, including force majeure events; or (iv) Customer’s
      equipment, services, or other technology.
    </p>
    <h2 id="service-credits-redemption">Service Credits Redemption</h2>
    <p>
      If GitHub does not meet this SLA, Customer may redeem Service Credits only
      upon written request to GitHub within thirty (30) days of the end of the
      calendar quarter. Written requests for Service Credits redemption and
      GitHub Enterprise Cloud custom monthly or quarterly reports should be sent
      to <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service Credits may take the form of a refund or credit to Customer’s
      account, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are limited to a maximum
      of ninety (90) days of paid service per calendar quarter, require Customer
      to have paid any outstanding invoices, and expire upon termination of
      Customer’s agreement with GitHub. Service Credits are the sole and
      exclusive remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any obligations in this
      SLA.
