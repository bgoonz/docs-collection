      1. GitHub.com’s Terms of Service and the GitHub Enterprise Software
      License Agreement Will Apply; Pricing
    </h2>
    <p>
      Customer can enable unified integrations, which allow Customer’s
      Enterprise users to connect with GitHub.com (“GitHub Connect”). In order
      to access GitHub Connect, Customer must have at least one (1) account on
      GitHub.com and one (1) licensed instance of GitHub Enterprise. Customer’s
      access to GitHub Connect will also be governed by its applicable
      GitHub.com Terms of Service and the Agreement which are hereby
      incorporated by reference, (the “Generally Applicable Terms”), such that
      the Generally Applicable Terms will apply concurrently. In the event of a
      direct conflict between this Addendum and the Generally Applicable Terms,
      the Generally Applicable Terms will control, except with respect to any
      use of GitHub Connect, in which case this Addendum will control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customer may not use GitHub Connect to violate its Generally Applicable
      Terms. Any use of GitHub Connect that violates the Generally Applicable
      Terms will also be a violation of this Addendum. GitHub Connect may be
      used for performing automated tasks. In addition, multiple Users may
      direct certain actions with GitHub Connect. Customer is responsible for
      actions that are performed on or through Customer’s accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation in GitHub Connect is provided at no additional charge
      through the Addendum Term (as defined below).
    </p>
    <h2 id="confidentiality">2. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent they do not conflict with the confidentiality obligations
      provided in the GitHub Enterprise Software License Agreement, GitHub
      Connect including any Confidential Information will be governed by the
      confidentiality obligations stated herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this Addendum, “Confidential Information” means any
      business or technical information shared with the other party
      (specifically excluding any Content or information created or shared on
      the Service or Website, which Content or information is governed by other
      provisions in this Addendum and the Generally Applicable Terms) that
      either one of us discloses to the other, in writing, orally, or by any
      other means, and including things like computer programs, code,
      algorithms, data, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions
      (whether patentable or not), schematics and other technical, business,
      financial, and product development plans, names and expertise of employees
      and consultants, and customer lists. Each party agrees to maintain the
      other party’s Confidential Information in confidence using at least the
      same degree of care as it uses in safeguarding its own Confidential
      Information, subject to a minimum standard of reasonable diligence and
      protection.

      data relating to their configurations and combinations; and all
      modifications to and derivative works of any of the foregoing. Customer
      must not remove, alter, cover or obfuscate any copyright or other
      proprietary rights notices that GitHub places on or embeds in GitHub

    </p>
    <h2 id="independent-development">8. Independent Development</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="privacy">9. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub may collect information about how Customer uses GitHub Connect and
      how GitHub can improve it. Customer may enable GitHub Connect to authorize
      GitHub to collect protected data, which includes private repository data
      and Customer Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy
      Statement), from Customer’s Enterprise account. If Customer connects its
      Enterprise instance with its GitHub.com account, Customer sends
      identifying instance information to GitHub.com, which information is
      governed by
      <a href="/articles/github-privacy-statement/"
        >GitHub’s Privacy Statement</a
      >. By enabling this configuration, Customer agrees that it is responsible
      for the actions that are performed on or through its account, subject to
      the terms of its Generally Applicable Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub may collect certain additional personal information from Customer
      in GitHub Connect. For example, GitHub may invite Customer to send
      Feedback (as explained in Section 10). GitHub may ask questions about
      Customer’s users’ experiences, familiarity with the product, or
      demographic information. GitHub will use this information to improve its
      products and services, and will not sell it to third parties or
      advertisers. Customer may decline to give feedback, decline to answer
      specific questions, or contact GitHub to delete or alter the information
      it has provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub’s servers are located in the United States. GitHub processes and
      controls Customer’s data in the United States. However, Customer is solely
      responsible for determining what personal data it submits to GitHub.
      Please refer to our
      <a href="/articles/github-privacy-statement/">Privacy Statement</a> for
      more information.
    </p>
    <h2 id="feedback">10. Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      Customer may, at its option, provide ideas, know-how, algorithms, code
      contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any
      other feedback for GitHub Connect or GitHub’s other products or services
      (collectively, “Feedback”). If Customer provides Feedback, it acknowledges
      and agrees that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide,
      transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to
      implement, use, modify, commercially exploit or incorporate the Feedback
      into its products, services, and documentation.
