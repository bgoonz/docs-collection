## Introduction

Educators who teach a course on software development can use discounts, partnerships, training, and tools from {% data variables.product.prodname_education %} to effectively teach relevant skills to students.

In this guide, you'll get started with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, sign up for accounts and discounted services through {% data variables.product.prodname_education %}, and create a space for your course and assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

{% tip %}

**Tip**: If you're a student and you'd like to take advantage of an academic discount, see "[Applying for a student developer pack](/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack)."
