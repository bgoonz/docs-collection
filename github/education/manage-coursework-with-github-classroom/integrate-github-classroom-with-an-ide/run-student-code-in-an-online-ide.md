## About student code and online IDEs

If you configure an online integrated development environment (IDE) for an assignment, you can run the code within the online IDE. You don't need to clone the assignment repository to your computer.

For more information about online IDEs, see "[Integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an online IDE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-online-ide)."
