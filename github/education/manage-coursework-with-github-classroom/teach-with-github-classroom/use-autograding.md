## About autograding

{% data reusables.classroom.about-autograding %}

After a student accepts an assignment, on every push to the assignment repository, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} runs the commands for your autograding test in a Linux environment containing the student's newest code. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} creates the necessary workflows for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. You don't need experience with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to use autograding.

You can use a testing framework, run a custom command, write input/output tests, or combine different testing methods. The Linux environment for autograding contains many popular software tools. For more information, see the details for the latest version of Ubuntu in "[Specifications for  {% data variables.product.company_short %}-hosted runners](/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-software)."

You can see an overview of which students are passing autograding tests by navigating to the assignment in {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. A green checkmark means that all tests are passing for the student, and a red X means that some or all tests are failing for the student. If you award points for one or more tests, then a bubble shows the score for the tests out of the maximum possible score for the assignment.

## Grading methods

There are two grading methods: input/output tests and run command tests.

### Input/output test

An input/output test optionally runs a setup command, then provides standard input to a test command. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} evaluates the test command's output against an expected result.

| Setting | Description |
| :- | :- |
| **Test name** | The name of the test, to identify the test in logs |
| **Setup command** | _Optional_. A command to run before tests, such as compilation or installation |
| **Run command** | The command to run the test and generate standard output for evaluation |
| **Inputs** | Standard input for run command |
| **Expected output** | The output that you want to see as standard output from the run command |
| **Comparison** | The type of comparison between the run command's output and the expected output<br/><br/><ul><li>**Included**: Passes when the expected output appears<br/>anywhere in the standard output from the run command</li><li>**Exact**: Passes when the expected output is completely identical<br/>to the standard output from the run command</li><li>**Regex**: Passes if the regular expression in expected<br/>output matches against the standard output from the run command</li></ul> |
| **Timeout** | In minutes, how long a test should run before resulting in failure |
| **Points** | _Optional_. The number of points the test is worth toward a total score |

### Run command test

A run command test runs a setup command, then runs a test command. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} checks the exit status of the test command. An exit code of `0` results in success, and any other exit code results in failure.

{% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} provides presets for language-specific run command tests for a variety of programming languages. For example, the **Run node** test prefills the setup command with `npm install` and the test command with `npm test`.

| Setting | Description |
| :- | :- |
| **Test name** | The name of the test, to identify the test in logs |
| **Setup command** | _Optional_. A command to run before tests, such as compilation or installation |
| **Run command** | The command to run the test and generate an exit code for evaluation |
| **Timeout** | In minutes, how long a test should run before resulting in failure |
| **Points** | _Optional_. The number of points the test is worth toward a total score |

## Configuring autograding tests for an assignment

You can add autograding tests during the creation of a new assignment. {% data reusables.classroom.for-more-information-about-assignment-creation %}

You can add, edit, or delete autograding tests for an existing assignment. If you change the autograding tests for an existing assignment, existing assignment repositories will not be affected. A student or team must accept the assignment and create a new assignment repository to use the new tests.
