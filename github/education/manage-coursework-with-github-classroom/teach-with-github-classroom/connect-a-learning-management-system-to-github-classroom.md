## About configuration of your LMS

You can connect a learning management system (LMS) to {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} can import a roster of student identifiers from the LMS. To connect your LMS to {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, you must enter configuration credentials for {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} in your LMS.

## Prerequisites

To configure an LMS to connect to {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, you must first create a classroom. For more information, see "[Manage classrooms](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms#creating-a-classroom)."

## Supported LMSes

{% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} supports import of roster data from LMSes that implement Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards.

- LTI version 1.0 and/or 1.1
- LTI Names and Roles Provisioning 1.X

Using LTI helps keep your information safe and secure. LTI is an industry-standard protocol and GitHub Classroom's use of LTI is certified by the Instructional Management System (IMS) Global Learning Consortium. For more information, see [Learning Tools Interoperability](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) and [About IMS Global Learning Consortium](http://www.imsglobal.org/aboutims.html) on the IMS Global Learning Consortium website.

{% data variables.product.company_short %} has tested import of roster data from the following LMSes into {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

- Canvas
- Google Classroom
- Moodle
- Sakai

Currently, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} doesn't support import of roster data from Blackboard or Brightspace.

## Generating configuration credentials for your classroom

{% data reusables.classroom.sign-into-github-classroom %}
{% data reusables.classroom.click-classroom-in-list %}
{% data reusables.classroom.click-students %}
1. If your classroom already has a roster, you can either update the roster or delete the roster and create a new roster.
    - For more information about deleting and creating a roster, see "[Deleting a roster for a classroom](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms#deleting-a-roster-for-a-classroom)" and "[Creating a roster for your classroom](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms#creating-a-roster-for-your-classroom)."
    - For more information about updating a roster, see "[Adding students to the roster for your classroom](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms#adding-students-to-the-roster-for-your-classroom)."
1. In the list of LMSes, click your LMS. If your LMS is not supported, click **Other LMS**.
