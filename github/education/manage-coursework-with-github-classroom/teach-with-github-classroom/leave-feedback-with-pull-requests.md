## About feedback pull requests for assignments

{% data reusables.classroom.you-can-create-a-pull-request-for-feedback %}

When you enable the pull request for feedback for an assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will create a special pull request titled **Feedback** in the assignment repository for each student or team. The pull request automatically shows every commit that a student pushed to the assignment repository's default branch.

## Prerequisites

To create and access the feedback pull request, you must enable the feedback pull request when you create the assignment. {% data reusables.classroom.for-more-information-about-assignment-creation %}
