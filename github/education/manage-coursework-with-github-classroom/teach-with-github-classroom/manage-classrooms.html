<p>{% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} uses organization accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage permissions, administration, and security for each classroom that you create. Each organization can have multiple classrooms.</p>
<p>After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you’d like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.</p>
<p>Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classroom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see “<a href="/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/permission-levels-for-an-organization">Permission levels for an organization</a>” and “<a href="/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization">Inviting users to join your organization</a>.”</p>
<p>When you’re done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.</p>
<h2 id="about-classroom-rosters">About classroom rosters</h2>
<p>Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.</p>
<p>When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.</p>
