      {% data reusables.classroom.assignments-group-definition %} Students can
      work together on a group assignment in a shared repository, like a team of
      professional developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a student accepts a group assignment, the student can create a new
      team or join an existing team. {% data
      variables.product.prodname_classroom %} saves the teams for an assignment
      as a set. You can name the set of teams for a specific assignment when you
      create the assignment, and you can reuse that set of teams for a later
      assignment.
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.classroom.classroom-creates-group-repositories %}</p>
    <p>{% data reusables.classroom.about-assignments %}</p>
    <p>
      You can decide how many teams one assignment can have, and how many
      members each team can have. Each team that a student creates for an
      assignment is a team within your organization on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}. The visibility of the team is secret.
      Teams that you create on {% data variables.product.product_name %} will
      not appear in {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. For more
      information, see “<a

      For a group assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}
      names repositories by the repository prefix and the name of the team. By
      default, the repository prefix is the assignment title. For example, if
      you name an assignment “assignment-1” and the team’s name on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} is “student-team”, the name of the
      assignment repository for members of the team will be
      <code>assignment-1-student-team</code>.

      If you’ve already created a group assignment for the classroom, you can
      reuse a set of teams for the new assignment. To create a new set with the
      teams that your students create for the assignment, type the name for the
      set. Optionally, type the maximum number of team members and total teams.

    <p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We recommend including details about the set of teams in the name for
          the set. For example, if you want to use the set of teams for one
          assignment, name the set after the assignment. If you want to reuse
          the set throughout a semester or course, name the set after the
          semester or course.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you’d like to assign students to a specific team, give your
          students a name for the team and provide a list of members.

          After you create the assignment and your students form teams, team
          members can start work on the assignment using Git and {% data

          repository, push commits, manage branches, create and review pull
          requests, address merge conflicts, and discuss changes with issues.
          Both you and the team can review the commit history for the
          repository. For more information, see “<a
