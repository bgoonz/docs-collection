Using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} for your school projects is a practical way to collaborate with others and build a portfolio that showcases real-world experience.

{% data reusables.education.about-github-education-link %}

Everyone with a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account can collaborate in unlimited public and private repositories with {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %}. As a student, you can also apply for GitHub Student benefits, which includes access to GitHub Global Campus, a digital campus for our GitHub student community to take advantage of some of the best programs that GitHub Education has to offer. GitHub Global Campus includes the {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %}, which offers free access to tools and services used by professional developers, as well as access to [Campus TV](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation) content, student events, GitHub Classroom Assignments, and much more, to help students with their technical career goals.

If you're a member of a FIRST robotics club, your mentor can apply for an educator discount so your team can collaborate using {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, which allows unlimited users and private repositories, for free.
