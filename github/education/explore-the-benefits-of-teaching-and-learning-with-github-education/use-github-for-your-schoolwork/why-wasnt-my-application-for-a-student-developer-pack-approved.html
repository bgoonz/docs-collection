<h2 id="academic-email-address-already-used">Academic email address already used</h2>
<p>If your academic email address was already used to request a {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %} for a different {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account, you cannot reuse the academic email address to successfully apply for another {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %}.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is against the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} <a href="/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements">Terms of Service</a> to maintain more than one individual account.</p>
<p>{% endnote %}</p>
<p>If you have more than one personal user account, you must merge your accounts. To retain the discount, keep the account that was granted the discount. You can rename the retained account and keep your contribution history by adding all your email addresses to the retained account.</p>
<p>For more information, see: - “<a href="/articles/merging-multiple-user-accounts">Merging multiple user accounts</a>” - “<a href="/articles/changing-your-github-username">Changing your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username</a>” - “<a href="/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account">Adding an email address to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account</a>”</p>
<h2 id="ineligible-student-status">Ineligible student status</h2>

<p>Your instructor may still apply for a {% data variables.product.prodname_education %} discount for classroom use.
