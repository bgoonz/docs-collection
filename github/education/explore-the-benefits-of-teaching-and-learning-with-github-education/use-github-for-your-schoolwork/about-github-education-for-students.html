      Using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} for your school
      projects is a practical way to collaborate with others and build a
      portfolio that showcases real-world experience.

    <p>
      Everyone with a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account can
      collaborate in unlimited public and private repositories with {% data
      variables.product.prodname_free_user %}. As a student, you can also apply
      for GitHub Student benefits, which includes access to GitHub Global
      Campus, a digital campus for our GitHub student community to take
      advantage of some of the best programs that GitHub Education has to offer.
      GitHub Global Campus includes the {% data
      variables.product.prodname_student_pack %}, which offers free access to
      tools and services used by professional developers, as well as access to
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation">Campus TV</a> content,
      student events, GitHub Classroom Assignments, and much more, to help
      students with their technical career goals. For more information, see “<a

      If you’re a member of a FIRST robotics club, your mentor can apply for an

      private repositories, for free. For more information, see “<a
