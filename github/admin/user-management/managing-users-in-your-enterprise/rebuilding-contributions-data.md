Whenever a commit is pushed to {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}, it is linked to a user account if they are both associated with the same email address. However, existing commits are *not* retroactively linked when a user registers a new email address or creates a new account.

1. Visit the user's profile page.
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.access-settings %}
3. On the left side of the page, click **Admin**.

4. Under **Contributions data**, click **Rebuild**.

{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} will now start background jobs to re-link commits with that user's account.
