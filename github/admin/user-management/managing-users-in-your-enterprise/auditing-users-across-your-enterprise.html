      The audit log lists the following information about actions made within
      your enterprise:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-repository">The repository</a> an action
        was performed in
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-user">The user</a> who performed the
        action
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-organization">Which organization</a> an
        action pertained to
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-action-performed">The action</a> that was
        performed
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-location">Which country</a> the action
        took place in
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#search-based-on-the-time-of-action">The date and time</a> the
        action occurred

    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        While you can’t use text to search for audit entries, you can construct
        search queries using a variety of filters. {% data
        variables.product.product_name %} supports many operators for searching
        across {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information,
        see “<a
          href="/github/searching-for-information-on-github/about-searching-on-github"
          >About searching on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        To search for events older than 90 days, use the
        <code>created</code> qualifier.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-repository">Search based on the repository</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>repo</code> qualifier limits actions to a specific repository
      owned by your organization. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>repo:my-org/our-repo</code> finds all events that occurred for the
        <code>our-repo</code> repository in the
        <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>repo:my-org/our-repo repo:my-org/another-repo</code> finds all
        events that occurred for both the <code>our-repo</code> and
        <code>another-repo</code> repositories in the
        <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-repo:my-org/not-this-repo</code> excludes all events that
        occurred for the <code>not-this-repo</code> repository in the
        <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must include your organization’s name within the
      <code>repo</code> qualifier; searching for just
      <code>repo:our-repo</code> will not work.
    </p>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-user">Search based on the user</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>actor</code> qualifier scopes events based on the member of your
      organization that performed the action. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>actor:octocat</code> finds all events performed by
        <code>octocat</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>actor:octocat actor:hubot</code> finds all events performed by
        both <code>octocat</code> and <code>hubot</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-actor:hubot</code> excludes all events performed by
        <code>hubot</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can only use a {% data variables.product.product_name %} username, not
      an individual’s real name.
    </p>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-organization">
      Search based on the organization
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>org</code> qualifier limits actions to a specific organization.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>org:my-org</code> finds all events that occurred for the
        <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>org:my-org action:team</code> finds all team events performed
        within the <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-org:my-org</code> excludes all events that occurred for the
        <code>my-org</code> organization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-action-performed">
      Search based on the action performed
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>action</code> qualifier searches for specific events, grouped
      within categories. For information on the events associated with these
      categories, see “<a href="/admin/user-management/audited-actions"
        >Audited actions</a
      >”.
    </p>
    <table>
      <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 48%" />
        <col style="width: 51%" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>hook</code></td>
          <td>Contains all activities related to webhooks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>org</code></td>
          <td>Contains all activities related organization membership</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>repo</code></td>
          <td>
            Contains all activities related to the repositories owned by your
            organization.

        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>team</code></td>
          <td>
            Contains all activities related to teams in your organization.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>action:team</code> finds all events grouped within the team
        category.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-action:billing</code> excludes all events in the billing
        category.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each category has a set of associated events that you can filter on. For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>action:team.create</code> finds all events where a team was
        created.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-action:billing.change_email</code> excludes all events where the
        billing email was changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-location">Search based on the location</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>country</code> qualifier filters actions by the originating
      country. - You can use a country’s two-letter short code or its full name.
      - Countries with spaces in their name must be wrapped in quotation marks.
      For example: * <code>country:de</code> finds all events that occurred in
      Germany. * <code>country:Mexico</code> finds all events that occurred in
      Mexico. * <code>country:"United States"</code> all finds events that
      occurred in the United States.
    </p>
    <h3 id="search-based-on-the-time-of-action">
      Search based on the time of action
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>created</code> qualifier filters actions by the time they
      occurred. - Define dates using the format of
      <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>–that’s year, followed by month, followed by day. -
      Dates support
      <a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/user/articles/search-syntax"
        >greater than, less than, and range qualifiers</a
      >. For example: * <code>created:2014-07-08</code> finds all events that
      occurred on July 8th, 2014. * <code>created:&gt;=2014-07-01</code> finds
      all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014. *
      <code>created:&lt;=2014-07-01</code> finds all events that occurred on or
      before July 8th, 2014. * <code>created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31</code> finds
      all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.
