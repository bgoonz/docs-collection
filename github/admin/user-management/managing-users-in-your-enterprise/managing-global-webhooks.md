## About global webhooks

You can use global webhooks to automatically monitor, respond to, or enforce rules for user and organization management for your enterprise. For example, you can configure your webhooks to execute whenever:
- A user account is created or deleted
- An organization is created or deleted
- A collaborator is added to or removed from a repository
- A repository is forked

  **Warning:** SSL verification helps ensure that hook payloads are delivered securely. We do not recommend disabling SSL verification.
