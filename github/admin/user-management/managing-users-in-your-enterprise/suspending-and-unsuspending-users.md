shortTitle: Manage user suspension
---
If employees leave the company, you can suspend their {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} accounts to open up user licenses in your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} license while preserving the issues, comments, repositories, gists, and other data they created. Suspended users cannot sign into your instance, nor can they push or pull code.

When you suspend a user, the change takes effect immediately with no notification to the user. If the user attempts to pull or push to a repository, they'll receive this error:

```shell
$ git clone git@[hostname]:john-doe/test-repo.git
Cloning into 'test-repo'...
ERROR: Your account is suspended. Please check with your installation administrator.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

Before suspending site administrators, you must demote them to regular users. For more information, see "[Promoting or demoting a site administrator](/enterprise/admin/user-management/promoting-or-demoting-a-site-administrator)."

{% tip %}

**Note:** If [LDAP Sync is enabled](/enterprise/admin/authentication/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync) for {% data variables.product.product_location %}, users are automatically suspended when they're removed from the LDAP directory server. When LDAP Sync is enabled for your instance, normal user suspension methods are disabled.

{% endtip %}

## Creating a custom message for suspended users

You can create a custom message that suspended users will see when attempting to sign in.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.messages-tab %}
5. Click **Add message**.
