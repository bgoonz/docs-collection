    <p>{% ifversion ghes %} ## Enabling two-factor authentication</p>
    <p>
      Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way of logging in to websites and
      services that requires a second factor beyond a password for
      authentication. In {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}’s
      case, this second factor is a one time authentication code generated by an
      application on a user’s smartphone. We strongly recommend requiring your
      users to enable two-factor authentication on their accounts. With
      two-factor authentication, both a user’s password and their smartphone
      would have to be compromised to allow the account itself to be
      compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on configuring two-factor authentication, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/user/articles/about-two-factor-authentication"
        >About two-factor authentication</a
      >”. {% endif %}

    <h2 id="requiring-a-password-manager">Requiring a password manager</h2>
    <p>
      We strongly recommend requiring your users to install and use a password
      manager–such as <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>,
      <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, or
      <a href="https://keepersecurity.com/">Keeper</a>–on any computer they use
      to connect to your enterprise. Doing so ensures that passwords are
      stronger and much less likely to be compromised or stolen.
    </p>
    <h2 id="restrict-access-to-teams-and-repositories">
      Restrict access to teams and repositories
    </h2>
    <p>
      To limit the potential attack surface in the event of a security breach,
      we strongly recommend only giving users access to teams and repositories
      that they absolutely need to do their work. Since members with the Owner
      role can access all teams and repositories in the organization, we
      strongly recommend keeping this team as small as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on configuring teams and team permissions, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/user/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/"
        >Permission levels for an organization repository</a
      >”.
