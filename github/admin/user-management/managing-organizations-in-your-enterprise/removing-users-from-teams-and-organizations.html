      Only owners or team admins can remove organization members. When a user is
      removed from a team or organization, their issues, pull requests, and
      comments in the organization’s repositories remain intact and are still
      attributed to the user.
    </p>
    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning</strong>: When you remove a user from an organization,
      they will lose access to any private forks they have of your
      organization’s <strong>private repositories</strong>. They may still have
      local copies of those forks. However, they will be unable to sync them
      with your organization’s repositories. You are responsible for ensuring
      that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential
      information or intellectual property. If the user removed from your
      organization was an organization member, their access to private forks of
      organization repositories can be restored if the user is
      <a href="/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization"
        >reinstated as an organization member</a
      >
      within three months of being removed from an organization.
