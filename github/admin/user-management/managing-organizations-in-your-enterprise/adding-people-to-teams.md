Each team has its own individually defined [access permissions for repositories owned by your organization](/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization).

- Members with the owner role can add or remove existing organization members from all teams.
- Members of teams that give admin permissions can only modify team membership and repositories for that team.

## Setting up a team

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.specific_team %}
{% data reusables.organizations.invite_to_team %}
{% data reusables.organizations.review-team-repository-access %}

## Mapping teams to LDAP groups (for instances using LDAP Sync for user authentication)

{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.badge_indicator %}

To add a new member to a team synced to an LDAP group, add the user as a member of the LDAP group, or contact your LDAP administrator.
