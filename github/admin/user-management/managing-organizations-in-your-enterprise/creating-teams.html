      Teams are central to many of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %}’s collaborative features, such as team
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentions">@mentions</span> to notify
      appropriate parties that you’d like to request their input or attention.
      For more information, see “<a

        >Permission levels for an organization repository</a
      >”.

    <p>
      A team can represent a group within your company or include people with
      certain interests or expertise. For example, a team of accessibility
      experts on {% data variables.product.product_location %} could comprise of
      people from several different departments. Teams can represent functional
      concerns that complement a company’s existing divisional hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations can create multiple levels of nested teams to reflect a
      company or group’s hierarchy structure. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/user/articles/about-teams/#nested-teams"

    <p>
      A prudent combination of teams is a powerful way to control repository
      access. For example, if your organization allows only your release
      engineering team to push code to the default branch of any repository, you
      could give only the release engineering team
      <strong>admin</strong> permissions to your organization’s repositories and
      give all other teams <strong>read</strong> permissions.

      Creating teams with LDAP Sync enabled
    </h2>
    <p>
      Instances using LDAP for user authentication can use LDAP Sync to manage a
      team’s members. Setting the group’s
      <strong>Distinguished Name</strong> (DN) in the
      <strong>LDAP group</strong> field will map a team to an LDAP group on your
      LDAP server. If you use LDAP Sync to manage a team’s members, you won’t be
      able to manage your team within {% data variables.product.product_location
      %}. The mapped team will sync its members in the background and
      periodically at the interval configured when LDAP Sync is enabled. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/admin/authentication/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync"
        >Enabling LDAP Sync</a
      >.”

    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> - LDAP Sync only manages the team’s member list.
      You must manage the team’s repositories and permissions from within {%
      data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. - If an LDAP group mapping
      to a DN is removed, such as if the LDAP group is deleted, then every
      member is removed from the synced {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} team. To fix this, map the team
      to a new DN, add the team members back, and
      <a
        href="/enterprise/admin/authentication/using-ldap#manually-syncing-ldap-accounts"
        >manually sync the mapping</a
      >. - When LDAP Sync is enabled, if a person is removed from a repository,
      they will lose access but their forks will not be deleted. If the person
      is added to a team with access to the original organization repository
      within three months, their access to the forks will be automatically
      restored on the next sync.
