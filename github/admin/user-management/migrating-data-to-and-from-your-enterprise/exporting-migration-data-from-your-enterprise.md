title: Exporting migration data from your enterprise
intro: 'To change platforms or move from a trial instance to a production instance, you can export migration data from a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance by preparing the instance, locking the repositories, and generating a migration archive.'

## Preparing the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} source instance

1. Verify that you are a site administrator on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} source. The best way to do this is to verify that you can [SSH into the instance](/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh/).

2. {% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.token-generation %} on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} source instance.

{% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.make-a-list %}

## Exporting the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} source repositories

{% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.locking-repositories %}

{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.ssh-into-instance %}
2. To prepare a repository for export, use the `ghe-migrator add` command with the repository's URL:
    * If you're locking the repository, append the command with `--lock`. If you're performing a trial run, `--lock` is not needed.
      ```shell
      $ ghe-migrator add https://<em>hostname</em>/<em>username</em>/<em>reponame</em> --lock
      ```
    * You can exclude file attachments by appending `--exclude_attachments` to the command. {% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.exclude-file-attachments %}
    * To prepare multiple repositories at once for export, create a text file listing each repository URL on a separate line, and run the `ghe-migrator add` command with the `-i` flag and the path to your text file.
      ```shell
      $ ghe-migrator add -i <em>PATH</em>/<em>TO</em>/<em>YOUR</em>/<em>REPOSITORY_URLS</em>.txt
      ```

3. When prompted, enter your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} username:
  ```shell
  Enter username authorized for migration:  admin
  ```
4. When prompted for a personal access token, enter the access token you created in "[Preparing the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} source instance](#preparing-the-github-enterprise-server-source-instance)":
  ```shell
  Enter personal access token:  **************
  ```
5. When `ghe-migrator add` has finished it will print the unique "Migration GUID" that it generated to identify this export as well as a list of the resources that were added to the export. You will use the Migration GUID that it generated in subsequent `ghe-migrator add` and `ghe-migrator export` steps to tell `ghe-migrator` to continue operating on the same export.
  ```shell
  > 101 models added to export
  > Migration GUID: <em>example-migration-guid</em>
  > Number of records in this migration:
  > users                        |  5
  > organizations                |  1
  > repositories                 |  1
  > teams                        |  3
  > protected_branches           |  1
  > pull_request_reviews         |  1
  > milestones                   |  1
  > issues                       |  3
  > pull_requests                |  5
  > pull_request_review_comments |  4
  > commit_comments              |  2
  > issue_comments               | 10
  > issue_events                 | 63
  > releases                     |  3
  > attachments                  |  4
  > projects                     |  2
  ```
  Each time you add a new repository with an existing Migration GUID it will update the existing export. If you run `ghe-migrator add` again without a Migration GUID it will start a new export and generate a new Migration GUID. **Do not re-use the Migration GUID generated during an export when you start preparing your migration for import**.

3. If you locked the source repository, you can use the `ghe-migrator target_url` command to set a custom lock message on the repository page that links to the repository's new location. Pass the source repository URL, the target repository URL, and the Migration GUID from Step 5:

  ```shell
  $ ghe-migrator target_url https://<em>hostname</em>/<em>username</em>/<em>reponame</em> https://<em>target_hostname</em>/<em>target_username</em>/<em>target_reponame</em> -g <em>MIGRATION_GUID</em>
  ```

6. To add more repositories to the same export, use the `ghe-migrator add` command with the `-g` flag. You'll pass in the new repository URL and the Migration GUID from Step 5:
  ```shell
  $ ghe-migrator add https://<em>hostname</em>/<em>username</em>/<em>other_reponame</em> -g <em>MIGRATION_GUID</em> --lock
  ```
7. When you've finished adding repositories, generate the migration archive using the `ghe-migrator export` command with the `-g` flag and the Migration GUID from Step 5:
    ```shell
    $ ghe-migrator export -g <em>MIGRATION_GUID</em>
    > Archive saved to: /data/github/current/tmp/<em>MIGRATION_GUID</em>.tar.gz
    ```
    * {% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.specify-staging-path %}

8. Close the connection to {% data variables.product.product_location %}:
  ```shell
  $ exit
  > logout
  > Connection to <em>hostname</em> closed.
  ```
9. Copy the migration archive to your computer using the [`scp`](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/ssh-and-scp-howto-tips-tricks#scp) command. The archive file will be named with the Migration GUID:
  ```shell
  $ scp -P 122 admin@<em>hostname</em>:/data/github/current/tmp/<em>MIGRATION_GUID</em>.tar.gz ~/Desktop
  ```
{% data reusables.enterprise_migrations.ready-to-import-migrations %}
