## About authentication and user provisioning with Azure AD

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a service from Microsoft that allows you to centrally manage user accounts and access to web applications. For more information, see [What is Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) in the Microsoft Docs.

To manage identity and access for {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can use an Azure AD tenant as a SAML IdP for authentication. You can also configure Azure AD to automatically provision accounts and access membership with SCIM, which allows you to create {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} users and manage team and organization membership from your Azure AD tenant.

After you enable SAML SSO and SCIM for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} using Azure AD, you can accomplish the following from your Azure AD tenant.

- Assign the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} application on Azure AD to a user account to automatically create and grant access to a corresponding user account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
- Unassign the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} application to a user account on Azure AD to deactivate the corresponding user account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
- Assign the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} application to an IdP group on Azure AD to automatically create and grant access to user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} for all members of the IdP group. In addition, the IdP group is available on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} for connection to a team and its parent organization.
- Unassign the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} application from an IdP group to deactivate the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user accounts of all IdP users who had access only through that IdP group and remove the users from the parent organization. The IdP group will be disconnected from any teams on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

For more information about managing identity and access for your enterprise on {% data variables.product.product_location %}, see "[Managing identity and access for your enterprise](/admin/authentication/managing-identity-and-access-for-your-enterprise)." For more information about synchronizing teams with IdP groups, see "[Synchronizing a team with an identity provider group](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group)."

## Prerequisites

To configure authentication and user provisioning for {% data variables.product.product_name %} using Azure AD, you must have an Azure AD account and tenant. For more information, see the [Azure AD website](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/active-directory) and [Quickstart: Create an Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant) in the Microsoft Docs.

{% data reusables.saml.assert-the-administrator-attribute %} For more information about including the `administrator` attribute in the SAML claim from Azure AD, see [How to: customize claims issued in the SAML token for enterprise applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization) in the Microsoft Docs.

## Configuring authentication and user provisioning with Azure AD

{% ifversion ghae %}

1. In Azure AD, add {% data variables.product.ae_azure_ad_app_link %} to your tenant and configure single sign-on. For more information, see [Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/github-ae-tutorial) in the Microsoft Docs.

1. In {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}, enter the details for your Azure AD tenant.

   - {% data reusables.saml.ae-enable-saml-sso-during-bootstrapping %}

   - If you've already configured SAML SSO for {% data variables.product.product_location %} using another IdP and you want to use Azure AD instead, you can edit your configuration. For more information, see "[Configuring SAML single sign-on for your enterprise](/admin/authentication/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise#editing-the-saml-sso-configuration)."

1. Enable user provisioning in {% data variables.product.product_name %} and configure user provisioning in Azure AD. For more information, see "[Configuring user provisioning for your enterprise](/admin/authentication/configuring-user-provisioning-for-your-enterprise#enabling-user-provisioning-for-your-enterprise)."
