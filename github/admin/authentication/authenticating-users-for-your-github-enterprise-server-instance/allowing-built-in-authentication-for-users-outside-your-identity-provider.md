## About built-in authentication for users outside your identity provider

You can use built-in authentication for outside users when you are unable to add specific accounts to your identity provider (IdP), such as accounts for contractors or machine users. You can also use built-in authentication to access a fallback account if the identity provider is unavailable.

After built-in authentication is configured and a user successfully authenticates with SAML or CAS, they will no longer have the option to authenticate with a username and password. If a user successfully authenticates with LDAP, the credentials are no longer considered internal.

Built-in authentication for a specific IdP is disabled by default.

{% warning %}

**Warning:** If you disable built-in authentication, you must individually suspend any users that should no longer have access to the instance. For more information, see "[Suspending and unsuspending users](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/user-management/suspending-and-unsuspending-users)."

{% endwarning %}

## Configuring built-in authentication for users outside your identity provider

{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.access-settings %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.management-console %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.authentication %} 4. Select your identity provider.
![Select identity provider option](/assets/images/enterprise/management-console/identity-provider-select.gif) 5. Select **Allow creation of accounts with built-in authentication**.

{% data reusables.enterprise_user_management.2fa_is_available %}

## Inviting users outside your identity provider to authenticate to your instance

When a user accepts the invitation, they can use their username and password to sign in rather than signing in through the IdP.

{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.sign-in %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.access-settings %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.invite-user-sidebar-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.invite-user-reset-link %}
