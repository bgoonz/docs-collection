    <p>
      When a push occurs, each script runs in an isolated environment and can
      perform checks on the content of the push. The scripts will cause the push
      to be accepted if the exit status is 0, or rejected if the exit status is
      non-zero.
    </p>
    <h2 id="usage-scenarios">Usage scenarios</h2>
    <p>
      Use pre-receive hooks to satisfy business rules, enforce regulatory
      compliance, and prevent certain common mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of how you can use pre-receive hooks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Require commit messages to follow a specific pattern or format, such as
        including a valid ticket number or being over a certain length.
      </li>
      <li>Lock a branch or repository by rejecting all pushes.</li>
      <li>
        Prevent sensitive data from being added to the repository by blocking
        keywords, patterns or file types.
      </li>
      <li>Prevent a PR author from merging their own changes.</li>
    </ul>

      Impact on performance and workflows
    </h2>
    <p>
      Impact to developers and their workflows can be significant and must be
      considered carefully. Pre-receive hooks that are based on business needs
      and implemented thoughtfully will provide the most benefit to the
      organization as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-receive hooks can have unintended effects on the performance of {%
      data variables.product.product_location %} and should be carefully
      implemented and reviewed.
