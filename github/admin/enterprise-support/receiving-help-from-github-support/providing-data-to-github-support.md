## Creating and sharing diagnostic files

Diagnostics are an overview of a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance's settings and environment that contains:

- Client license information, including company name, expiration date, and number of user licenses
- Version numbers and SHAs
- VM architecture
- Host name, private mode, SSL settings
- Load and process listings
- Network settings
- Authentication method and details
- Number of repositories, users, and other installation data

You can download the diagnostics for your instance from the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} or by running the `ghe-diagnostics` command-line utility.

### Creating a diagnostic file from the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}

You can use this method if you don't have your SSH key readily available.

{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.access-settings %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.management-console %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.type-management-console-password %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.support-link %} 5. Click **Download diagnostics info**.

### Creating a diagnostic file using SSH

You can use this method without signing into the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}.

Use the [ghe-diagnostics](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/command-line-utilities#ghe-diagnostics) command-line utility to retrieve the diagnostics for your instance.

```shell
$ ssh -p122 admin@<em>hostname</em> -- 'ghe-diagnostics' > diagnostics.txt
```

## Creating and sharing support bundles

After you submit your support request, we may ask you to share a support bundle with our team. The support bundle is a gzip-compressed tar archive that includes diagnostics and important logs from your instance, such as:

- Authentication-related logs that may be helpful when troubleshooting authentication errors, or configuring LDAP, CAS, or SAML
- {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} log
- `github-logs/exceptions.log`: Information about 500 errors encountered on the site
- `github-logs/audit.log`: {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} audit logs
- `babeld-logs/babeld.log`: Git proxy logs
- `system-logs/haproxy.log`: HAProxy logs
- `elasticsearch-logs/github-enterprise.log`: Elasticsearch logs
- `configuration-logs/ghe-config.log`: {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} configuration logs
- `collectd/logs/collectd.log`: Collectd logs
- `mail-logs/mail.log`: SMTP email delivery logs
  {% ifversion ghes < 3.0 %}
- `hookshot-logs/exceptions.log`: Webhook delivery errors
  {% endif %}

For more information, see "[Audit logging](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/audit-logging)."

Support bundles include logs from the past two days. To get logs from the past seven days, you can download an extended support bundle. For more information, see "[Creating and sharing extended support bundles](#creating-and-sharing-extended-support-bundles)."

{% tip %}

**Tip:** When you contact {% data variables.contact.github_support %}, you'll be sent a confirmation email that will contain a ticket reference link. If {% data variables.contact.github_support %} asks you to upload a support bundle, you can use the ticket reference link to upload the support bundle.

{% endtip %}

### Creating a support bundle from the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}

You can use these steps to create and share a support bundle if you can access the web-based {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} and have outbound internet access.

{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.access-settings %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_site_admin_settings.management-console %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.type-management-console-password %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_management_console.support-link %} 5. Click **Download support bundle**.
{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.sign-in-to-support %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.upload-support-bundle %}

### Creating a support bundle using SSH

You can use these steps to create and share a support bundle if you have SSH access to {% data variables.product.product_location %} and have outbound internet access.

{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.use_ghe_cluster_support_bundle %}

1. Download the support bundle via SSH:

```shell
$ ssh -p 122 admin@<em>hostname</em> -- 'ghe-support-bundle -o' > support-bundle.tgz
```

For more information about the `ghe-support-bundle` command, see "[Command-line utilities](/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/command-line-utilities#ghe-support-bundle)".
{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.sign-in-to-support %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.upload-support-bundle %}

### Uploading a support bundle using your enterprise account

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise-on-dotcom %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.settings-tab %} 3. In the left sidebar, click **Enterprise licensing**.
!["Enterprise licensing" tab in the enterprise account settings sidebar](/assets/images/help/enterprises/enterprise-licensing-tab.png) 4. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} Help", click **Upload a support bundle**.
![Upload a support bundle link](/assets/images/enterprise/support/upload-support-bundle.png) 5. Under "Select an enterprise account", select the support bundle's associated account from the drop-down menu.
![Choose the support bundle's enterprise account](/assets/images/enterprise/support/support-bundle-account.png) 6. Under "Upload a support bundle for {% data variables.contact.enterprise_support %}", to select your support bundle, click **Choose file**, or drag your support bundle file onto **Choose file**.
![Upload support bundle file](/assets/images/enterprise/support/choose-support-bundle-file.png) 7. Click **Upload**.

### Uploading a support bundle directly using SSH

You can directly upload a support bundle to our server if:

- You have SSH access to {% data variables.product.product_location %}.
- Outbound HTTPS connections over TCP port 443 are allowed from {% data variables.product.product_location %} to _enterprise-bundles.github.com_ and _esbtoolsproduction.blob.core.windows.net_.

1. Upload the bundle to our support bundle server:

```shell
$ ssh -p122 admin@<em>hostname</em> -- 'ghe-support-bundle -u'
```

## Creating and sharing extended support bundles

Support bundles include logs from the past two days, while _extended_ support bundles include logs from the past seven days. If the events that {% data variables.contact.github_support %} is investigating occurred more than two days ago, we may ask you to share an extended support bundle. You will need SSH access to download an extended bundle - you cannot download an extended bundle from the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}.

To prevent bundles from becoming too large, bundles only contain logs that haven't been rotated and compressed. Log rotation on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} happens at various frequencies (daily or weekly) for different log files, depending on how large we expect the logs to be.

### Creating an extended support bundle using SSH

You can use these steps to create and share an extended support bundle if you have SSH access to {% data variables.product.product_location %} and you have outbound internet access.

1. Download the extended support bundle via SSH by adding the `-x` flag to the `ghe-support-bundle` command:

```shell
$ ssh -p 122 admin@<em>hostname</em> -- 'ghe-support-bundle -o -x' > support-bundle.tgz
```

{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.sign-in-to-support %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_enterprise_support.upload-support-bundle %}

### Uploading an extended support bundle directly using SSH

You can directly upload a support bundle to our server if:

- You have SSH access to {% data variables.product.product_location %}.
- Outbound HTTPS connections over TCP port 443 are allowed from {% data variables.product.product_location %} to _enterprise-bundles.github.com_ and _esbtoolsproduction.blob.core.windows.net_.

1. Upload the bundle to our support bundle server:

```shell
$ ssh -p122 admin@<em>hostname</em> -- 'ghe-support-bundle -u -x'
```
