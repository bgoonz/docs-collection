{% ifversion ghes > 2.22 %}

This article explains how site administrators can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. It covers the hardware and software requirements, presents the storage options, and describes the security management policies.

{% endif %}

## Review hardware considerations

{% ifversion ghes = 2.22 or ghes = 3.0 %}

{% note %}

**Note**: {% ifversion ghes = 2.22 %}{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} was available for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.22 as a limited beta. {% endif %}If you're upgrading an existing {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance to 3.0 or later and want to configure {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, note that the minimum hardware requirements have increased. For more information, see "[Upgrading {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server#about-minimum-requirements-for-github-enterprise-server-30-and-later)."

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

The CPU and memory resources available to {% data variables.product.product_location %} determine the maximum job throughput for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

Internal testing at {% data variables.product.company_short %} demonstrated the following maximum throughput for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances with a range of CPU and memory configurations. You may see different throughput depending on the overall levels of activity on your instance.

| vCPUs | Memory | Maximum job throughput |
| :---- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| 4     | 32 GB  | Demo or light testing  |
| 8     | 64 GB  | 25 jobs                |
| 16    | 160 GB | 35 jobs                |
| 32    | 256 GB | 100 jobs               |

If you {% ifversion ghes = 2.22 %}enabled the beta of{% else %}plan to enable{% endif %} {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for the users of an existing instance, review the levels of activity for users and automations on the instance and ensure that you have provisioned adequate CPU and memory for your users. For more information about monitoring the capacity and performance of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, see "[Monitoring your appliance](/admin/enterprise-management/monitoring-your-appliance)."

For more information about minimum hardware requirements for {% data variables.product.product_location %}, see the hardware considerations for your instance's platform.

## External storage requirements

To enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, you must have access to external blob storage.

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses blob storage to store artifacts generated by workflow runs, such as workflow logs and user-uploaded build artifacts. The amount of storage required depends on your usage of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Only a single external storage configuration is supported, and you can't use multiple storage providers at the same time.

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} supports these storage providers:

- Azure Blob storage
- Amazon S3
- S3-compatible MinIO Gateway for NAS

{% note %}

**Note:** These are the only storage providers that {% data variables.product.company_short %} supports and can provide assistance with. Other S3 API-compatible storage providers are unlikely to work due to differences from the S3 API. [Contact us](https://support.github.com/contact) to request support for additional storage providers.

{% endnote %}

{% ifversion ghes = 2.22 %}

### Amazon S3 permissions

## Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} support on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.22 was available as a limited beta. To configure {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for your instance, upgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 or later. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 release notes](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes) and "[Upgrading {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes > 2.22 %}

## Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} with your storage provider

Follow one of the procedures below to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} with your chosen storage provider:

- [Enabling GitHub Actions with Azure Blob storage](/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-with-azure-blob-storage)
- [Enabling GitHub Actions with Amazon S3 storage](/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-with-amazon-s3-storage)
- [Enabling GitHub Actions with MinIO Gateway for NAS storage](/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-with-minio-gateway-for-nas-storage)

## Managing access permissions for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} in your enterprise

You can use policies to manage access to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "[Enforcing GitHub Actions policies for your enterprise](/admin/github-actions/enforcing-github-actions-policies-for-your-enterprise)."

## Adding self-hosted runners

{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

To run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows, you need to add self-hosted runners. You can add self-hosted runners at the enterprise, organization, or repository levels. For more information, see "[Adding self-hosted runners](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)."

## Managing which actions can be used in your enterprise

You can control which actions your users are allowed to use in your enterprise. This includes setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} for automatic access to actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, or manually syncing actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

For more information, see "[About using actions in your enterprise](/admin/github-actions/about-using-actions-in-your-enterprise)."

## General security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

If you want to learn more about security practices for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "[Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions)."
