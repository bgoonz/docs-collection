{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows can use _actions_, which are individual tasks that you can combine to create jobs and customize your workflow. You can create your own actions, or use and customize actions shared by the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} community.

## Official actions bundled with your enterprise instance

Most official {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-authored actions are automatically bundled with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, and are captured at a point in time from {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

The bundled official actions include `actions/checkout`, `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact`, `actions/labeler`, and various `actions/setup-` actions, among others. To see all the official actions included on your enterprise instance, browse to the `actions` organization on your instance: <code>https://<em>HOSTNAME</em>/actions</code>.

Each action is a repository in the `actions` organization, and each action repository includes the necessary tags, branches, and commit SHAs that your workflows can use to reference the action. For information on how to update the bundled official actions, see "[Using the latest version of the official bundled actions](/admin/github-actions/using-the-latest-version-of-the-official-bundled-actions)."

{% note %}

**Note:** When using setup actions (such as `actions/setup-LANGUAGE`) on {% data variables.product.product_name %} with self-hosted runners, you might need to set up the tools cache on runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see "[Setting up the tool cache on self-hosted runners without internet access](/enterprise/admin/github-actions/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)."

## Configuring access to actions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}

If users in your enterprise need access to other actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, there are a few configuration options.

The recommended approach is to enable automatic access to all actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. You can do this by using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} to integrate {% data variables.product.product_name %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. For more information, see "[Enabling automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}](/enterprise/admin/github-actions/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect)". {% data reusables.actions.enterprise-limit-actions-use %}

Alternatively, if you want stricter control over which actions are allowed in your enterprise, you can manually download and sync actions onto your enterprise instance using the `actions-sync` tool. For more information, see "[Manually syncing actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}](/enterprise/admin/github-actions/manually-syncing-actions-from-githubcom)."
