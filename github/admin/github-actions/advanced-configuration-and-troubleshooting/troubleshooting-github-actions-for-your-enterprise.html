      Installing the certificate on the runner machine
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a self-hosted runner to connect to a {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} using a self-signed certificate,
      you must install the certificate on the runner machine so that the
      connection is security hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the steps required to install a certificate, refer to the
      documentation for your runner’s operating system.
    </p>
    <h3 id="configuring-node.js-to-use-the-certificate">
      Configuring Node.JS to use the certificate
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most actions are written in JavaScript and run using Node.js, which does
      not use the operating system certificate store. For the self-hosted runner
      application to use the certificate, you must set the
      <code>NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS</code> environment variable on the runner
      machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can set the environment variable as a system environment variable, or
      declare it in a file named <em>.env</em> in the self-hosted runner
      application directory.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/share/ca-certificates/extra/mycertfile.crt</code></pre>
    <p>
      Environment variables are read when the self-hosted runner application
      starts, so you must set the environment variable before configuring or
      starting the self-hosted runner application. If your certificate
      configuration changes, you must restart the self-hosted runner
      application.
    </p>
    <h3 id="configuring-docker-containers-to-use-the-certificate">
      Configuring Docker containers to use the certificate
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you use Docker container actions or service containers in your
      workflows, you might also need to install the certificate in your Docker
      image in addition to setting the above environment variable.

      If these settings aren’t correctly configured, you might receive errors
      like
      <code>Resource unexpectedly moved to https://&lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;</code>
      when setting or changing your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions
      %} configuration.

      Runners not connecting to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}
      after changing the hostname
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you change the hostname of {% data variables.product.product_location
      %}, self-hosted runners will be unable to connect to the old hostname, and
      will not execute any jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to update the configuration of your self-hosted runners to
      use the new hostname for {% data variables.product.product_location %}.
      Each self-hosted runner will require one of the following procedures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the self-hosted runner application directory, edit the
        <code>.runner</code> and <code>.credentials</code> files to replace all
        mentions of the old hostname with the new hostname, then restart the
        self-hosted runner application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the runner from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}
        using the UI, and re-add it. For more information, see “<a
          href="/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/removing-self-hosted-runners"
          >Removing self-hosted runners</a
        >” and “<a
          href="/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners"

      Stuck jobs and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} memory and
      CPU limits
    </h2>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is composed of multiple
      services running on {% data variables.product.product_location %}. By
      default, these services are set up with default CPU and memory limits that
      should work for most instances. However, heavy users of {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} might need to adjust these settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be hitting the CPU or memory limits if you notice that jobs are
      not starting (even though there are idle runners), or if the job’s
      progress is not updating or changing in the UI.
    </p>
    <h3 id="check-the-overall-cpu-and-memory-usage-in-the-management-console">
      1. Check the overall CPU and memory usage in the management console
    </h3>
    <p>
      Access the management console and use the monitor dashboard to inspect the
      overall CPU and memory graphs under “System Health”. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/admin/enterprise-management/accessing-the-monitor-dashboard"
        >Accessing the monitor dashboard</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If the overall “System Health” CPU usage is close to 100%, or there is no
      free memory left, then {% data variables.product.product_location %} is
      running at capacity and needs to be scaled up. For more information, see
      “<a href="/admin/enterprise-management/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources"
        >Increasing CPU or memory resources</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h3
      id="check-the-nomad-jobs-cpu-and-memory-usage-in-the-management-console"
    >
      2. Check the Nomad Jobs CPU and memory usage in the management console
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the overall “System Health” CPU and memory usage is OK, scroll down the
      monitor dashboard page to the “Nomad Jobs” section, and look at the “CPU
      Percent Value” and “Memory Usage” graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each plot in these graphs corresponds to one service. For {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} services, look for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>mps_frontend</code></li>
      <li><code>mps_backend</code></li>
      <li><code>token_frontend</code></li>
      <li><code>token_backend</code></li>
      <li><code>actions_frontend</code></li>
      <li><code>actions_backend</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If any of these services are at or near 100% CPU utilization, or the
      memory is near their limit (2 GB by default), then the resource allocation
      for these services might need increasing. Take note of which of the above
      services are at or near their limit.
    </p>
    <h3 id="increase-the-resource-allocation-for-services-at-their-limit">
      3. Increase the resource allocation for services at their limit

        Log in to the administrative shell using SSH. For more information, see
        “<a href="/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh"
          >Accessing the administrative shell (SSH)</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Run the following command to see what resources are available for
          allocation:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell"><code>nomad node status -self</code></pre>
        <p>
          In the output, find the “Allocated Resources” section. It looks
          similar to the following example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Allocated Resources
CPU              Memory          Disk
7740/49600 MHZ   23 GiB/32 GiB   4.4 GiB/7.9 GiB</code></pre>
        <p>
          For CPU and memory, this shows how much is allocated to the
          <strong>total</strong> of <strong>all</strong> services (the left
          value) and how much is available (the right value). In the example
          above, there is 23 GiB of memory allocated out of 32 GiB total. This
          means there is 9 GiB of memory available for allocation.
        </p>
        <p>{% warning %}</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful not to allocate more than the
          total available resources, or services will fail to start.
        </p>
        {% endwarning %}

          Change directory to
          <code>/etc/consul-templates/etc/nomad-jobs/actions</code>:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="shell"
        ><code>cd /etc/consul-templates/etc/nomad-jobs/actions</code></pre>
        <p>
          In this directory there are three files that correspond to the {% data
          variables.product.prodname_actions %} services from above:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>mps.hcl.ctmpl</code></li>
          <li><code>token.hcl.ctmpl</code></li>
          <li><code>actions.hcl.ctmpl</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For the services that you identified that need adjustment, open the
          corresponding file and locate the <code>resources</code> group that
          looks like the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code>resources {
  cpu = 512
  memory = 2048
  network {
    port &quot;http&quot; { }
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          The values are in MHz for CPU resources, and MB for memory resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, to increase the resource limits in the above example to 1
          GHz for the CPU and 4 GB of memory, change it to:
        </p>
        <pre><code>resources {
  cpu = 1024
  memory = 4096
  network {
    port &quot;http&quot; { }
  }
}</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Save and exit the file.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Run <code>ghe-config-apply</code> to apply the changes.</p>
        When running <code>ghe-config-apply</code>, if you see output like
        <code>Failed to run nomad job '/etc/nomad-jobs/&lt;name&gt;.hcl'</code>,
        then the change has likely over-allocated CPU or memory resources. If
        this happens, edit the configuration files again and lower the allocated
        CPU or memory, then re-run <code>ghe-config-apply</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          After the configuration is applied, run
          <code>ghe-actions-check</code> to verify that the {% data
          variables.product.prodname_actions %} services are operational.
        </p>
      </li>
