{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-storage-ha-backups %}

If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %} to back up {% data variables.product.product_location %}, it's important to note that {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} data stored on your external storage provider is not included in the backup.

This is an overview of the steps required to restore {% data variables.product.product_location %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to a new appliance:

1. Confirm that the original appliance is offline.
1. Manually configure network settings on the replacement {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance. Network settings are excluded from the backup snapshot, and are not overwritten by `ghe-restore`.
1. Configure the replacement appliance to use the same {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} external storage configuration as the original appliance.
1. Enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on the replacement appliance. This will connect the replacement appliance to the same external storage for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.
1. After {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is configured with the external storage provider, use the `ghe-restore` command to restore the rest of the data from the backup. For more information, see "[Restoring a backup](/admin/configuration/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance#restoring-a-backup)."
1. Re-register your self-hosted runners on the replacement appliance. For more information, see [Adding self-hosted runners](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).
