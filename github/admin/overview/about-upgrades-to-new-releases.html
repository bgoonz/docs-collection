      {% data variables.product.product_name %} is constantly improving, with
      new functionality and bug fixes introduced through major and minor
      releases. {% ifversion ghae %}{% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} is a fully managed service, so
      {% data variables.product.company_short %} completes the upgrade process
      for your enterprise.{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      Major releases include new functionality and feature upgrades and
      typically occur {% ifversion ghae %}every few weeks or months{% else %}
      quarterly{% endif %}. {% ifversion ghae %}{% data
      variables.product.company_short %} will upgrade your enterprise to the
      latest major release. You will be given advance notice of any planned
      downtime for your enterprise.{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>{% ifversion ghes %}</p>
    <p>
      Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0, all
      major releases begin with at least one release candidate. Release
      candidates are proposed major releases, with a complete feature set. There
      may be bugs or issues in a release candidate which can only be found
      through feedback from customers actually using {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can get early access to the latest features by testing a release
      candidate as soon as the release candidate is available. You can upgrade
      to a release candidate from a supported version and can upgrade from the
      release candidate to later versions when released. You should upgrade any
      environment running a release candidate as soon as the release is
      generally available. For more information, see “<a
        href="/admin/enterprise-management/upgrade-requirements"
        >Upgrade requirements</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Release candidates should be deployed on test or staging environments. As
      you test a release candidate, please provide feedback by contacting
      support. For more information, see “<a href="/admin/enterprise-support"
        >Working with {% data variables.contact.github_support %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll use your feedback to apply bug fixes and any other necessary changes
      to create a stable production release. Each new release candidate adds bug
      fixes for issues found in prior versions. When the release is ready for
      widespread adoption, {% data variables.product.company_short %} publishes
      a stable production release.

    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning</strong>: The upgrade to a new major release will cause a
      few hours of downtime, during which none of your users will be able to use
      the enterprise. You can inform your users about downtime by publishing a
      global announcement banner, using your enterprise settings or the REST
      API. For more information, see “<a
        href="/admin/user-management/customizing-user-messages-on-your-instance#creating-a-global-announcement-banner"
        >Customizing user messages on your instance</a
      >” and “<a href="/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#announcements"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} administration</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <p>{% ifversion ghes %}</p>
    <p>
      Minor releases, which consist of hot patches and bug fixes only, happen
      more frequently. Minor releases are generally available when first
      released, with no release candidates. Upgrading to a minor release
      typically requires less than five minutes of downtime.
