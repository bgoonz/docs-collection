      {% data reusables.github-ae.about-billing %} Once per day, {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will count the number of users with a
      license for your enterprise. {% data variables.product.company_short %}
      bills you for each licensed user regardless of whether the user logged
      into {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For commercial regions, the price per user per day is $1.2580645161. For
      31-day months, the monthly cost for each user is $39. For months with
      fewer days, the monthly cost is lower. Each billing month begins at a
      fixed time on the first day of the calendar month.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you add a licensed user mid-month, that user will only be included in
      the count for the days they have a license. When you remove a licensed
      user, that user will remain in the count until the end of that month.
      Therefore, if you add a user mid-month and later remove the user in the
      same month, the user will be included in the count from the day the user
      was added through the end of the month. There is no additional cost if you
      re-add a user during the same month the user was removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, here are the costs for users with licenses on different
      dates.
