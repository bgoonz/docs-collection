## About data encryption

To provide a high level of security, {% data variables.product.product_name %} encrypts your data while at rest in the data centers and while your data is in transit between users' machines and the data centers.

For encryption in transit, {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses Transport Layer Security (TLS). For encryption at rest, {% data variables.product.product_name %} provides a default RSA key.
