{% tip %}

**Tip:** If SMTP errors occur while sending a test email—such as an immediate delivery failure or an outgoing mail configuration error—you will see them in the Test email settings dialog box.

{% endtip %}

4. If the test email fails, [troubleshoot your email settings](#troubleshooting-email-delivery).
5. When the test email succeeds, at the bottom of the page, click **Save settings**.

6. Wait for the configuration run to complete.
   ![Configuring your instance](/assets/images/enterprise/management-console/configuration-run.png)

## Configuring DNS and firewall settings to allow incoming emails

If you want to allow email replies to notifications, you must configure your DNS settings.

1. Ensure that port 25 on the instance is accessible to your SMTP server.
2. Create an A record that points to `reply.[hostname]`. Depending on your DNS provider and instance host configuration, you may be able to instead create a single A record that points to `*.[hostname]`.
3. Create an MX record that points to `reply.[hostname]` so that emails to that domain are routed to the instance.
4. Create an MX record that points `noreply.[hostname]` to `[hostname]` so that replies to the `cc` address in notification emails are routed to the instance. For more information, see {% ifversion ghes %}"[Configuring notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications){% else %}"[About email notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-email-notifications){% endif %}."

## Troubleshooting email delivery

### Create a Support Bundle

If you cannot determine what is wrong from the displayed error message, you can download a [support bundle](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/enterprise-support/providing-data-to-github-support) containing the entire SMTP conversation between your mail server and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. Once you've downloaded and extracted the bundle, check the entries in _enterprise-manage-logs/unicorn.log_ for the entire SMTP conversation log and any related errors.

The unicorn log should show a transaction similar to the following:

```shell
This is a test email generated from https://10.0.0.68/setup/settings
Connection opened: smtp.yourdomain.com:587
-> "220 smtp.yourdomain.com ESMTP nt3sm2942435pbc.14\r\n"
<- "EHLO yourdomain.com\r\n"
-> "250-smtp.yourdomain.com at your service, [1.2.3.4]\r\n"
-> "250-SIZE 35882577\r\n"
-> "250-8BITMIME\r\n"
-> "250-STARTTLS\r\n"
-> "250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\r\n"
-> "250 PIPELINING\r\n"
<- "STARTTLS\r\n"
-> "220 2.0.0 Ready to start TLS\r\n"
TLS connection started
<- "EHLO yourdomain.com\r\n"
-> "250-smtp.yourdomain.com at your service, [1.2.3.4]\r\n"
-> "250-SIZE 35882577\r\n"
-> "250-8BITMIME\r\n"
-> "250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN XOAUTH\r\n"
-> "250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\r\n"
-> "250 PIPELINING\r\n"
<- "AUTH LOGIN\r\n"
-> "334 VXNlcm5hbWU6\r\n"
<- "dGhpc2lzbXlAYWRkcmVzcy5jb20=\r\n"
-> "334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6\r\n"
<- "aXRyZWFsbHl3YXM=\r\n"
-> "535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at\r\n"
-> "535 5.7.1 http://support.yourdomain.com/smtp/auth-not-accepted nt3sm2942435pbc.14\r\n"
```

This log shows that the appliance:

- Opened a connection with the SMTP server (`Connection opened: smtp.yourdomain.com:587`).
- Successfully made a connection and chose to use TLS (`TLS connection started`).
- The `login` authentication type was performed (`<- "AUTH LOGIN\r\n"`).
- The SMTP Server rejected the authentication as invalid (`-> "535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted.`).

### Check {% data variables.product.product_location %} logs

If you need to verify that your inbound email is functioning, there are two log files that you can examine on your instance: To verify that _/var/log/mail.log_ and _/var/log/mail-replies/metroplex.log_.

_/var/log/mail.log_ verifies that messages are reaching your server. Here's an example of a successful email reply:

```
Oct 30 00:47:18 54-171-144-1 postfix/smtpd[13210]: connect from st11p06mm-asmtp002.mac.com[17.172.124.250]
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/smtpd[13210]: 51DC9163323: client=st11p06mm-asmtp002.mac.com[17.172.124.250]
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/cleanup[13216]: 51DC9163323: message-id=<b2b9c260-4aaa-4a93-acbb-0b2ddda68579@me.com>
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/qmgr[17250]: 51DC9163323: from=<tcook@icloud.com>, size=5048, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/virtual[13217]: 51DC9163323: to=<reply+i-1-1801beb4df676a79250d1e61e54ab763822c207d-5@reply.ghe.tjl2.co.ie>, relay=virtual, delay=0.12, delays=0.11/0/0/0, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (delivered to maildir)
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/qmgr[17250]: 51DC9163323: removed
Oct 30 00:47:19 54-171-144-1 postfix/smtpd[13210]: disconnect from st11p06mm-asmtp002.mac.com[17.172.124.250]
```

Note that the client first connects; then, the queue becomes active. Then, the message is delivered, the client is removed from the queue, and the session disconnects.

_/var/log/mail-replies/metroplex.log_ shows whether inbound emails are being processed to add to issues and pull requests as replies. Here's an example of a successful message:

```
[2014-10-30T00:47:23.306 INFO (5284) #] metroplex: processing <b2b9c260-4aaa-4a93-acbb-0b2ddda68579@me.com>
[2014-10-30T00:47:23.333 DEBUG (5284) #] Matched /data/user/mail/reply/new/1414630039.Vfc00I12000eM445784.ghe-tjl2-co-ie
[2014-10-30T00:47:23.334 DEBUG (5284) #] Moving /data/user/mail/reply/new/1414630039.Vfc00I12000eM445784.ghe-tjl2-co-ie => /data/user/incoming-mail/success
```

You'll notice that `metroplex` catches the inbound message, processes it, then moves the file over to `/data/user/incoming-mail/success`.{% endif %}

### Verify your DNS settings

In order to properly process inbound emails, you must configure a valid A Record (or CNAME), as well as an MX Record. For more information, see "[Configuring DNS and firewall settings to allow incoming emails](#configuring-dns-and-firewall-settings-to-allow-incoming-emails)."

### Check firewall or AWS Security Group settings

If {% data variables.product.product_location %} is behind a firewall or is being served through an AWS Security Group, make sure port 25 is open to all mail servers that send emails to `reply@reply.[hostname]`.

### Contact support

{% ifversion ghes %}
If you're still unable to resolve the problem, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_ent_support %}. Please attach the output file from `http(s)://[hostname]/setup/diagnostics` to your email to help us troubleshoot your problem.
