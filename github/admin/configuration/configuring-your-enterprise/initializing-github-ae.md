## About initialization

Before you can initialize your enterprise, you must purchase {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}.

{% data reusables.github-ae.initialize-enterprise %} Make sure the information you provide matches the intended enterprise owner's information in the IdP. For more information about enterprise owners, see "[Roles in an enterprise](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owner)."

{% note %}

**Notes**:

- If the initial password for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} expires before you finish initialization, you can request a password reset at any time from your invitation email.

- Store the initial username and password for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} securely in a password manager. {% data reusables.saml.contact-support-if-your-idp-is-unavailable %}

{% endnote %}

During initialization, the enterprise owner will name your enterprise, configure SAML SSO, create policies for all organizations in your enterprise, and configure a support contact for your users.

## Prerequisites

To begin initialization, you will receive an invitation email from {% data variables.product.company_short %}. Before you configure {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}, review the following prerequisites.

1. To initialize {% data variables.product.product_location %}, you must have a SAML identity provider (IdP). {% data reusables.saml.ae-uses-saml-sso %} To connect your IdP to your enterprise during initialization, you should have your IdP's Entity ID (SSO) URL, Issuer ID URL, and public signing certificate (Base64-encoded). For more information, see "[About identity and access management for your enterprise](/admin/authentication/about-identity-and-access-management-for-your-enterprise)."

   {% note %}

   **Note**: {% data reusables.saml.create-a-machine-user %}

   {% endnote %}

2. {% data reusables.saml.assert-the-administrator-attribute %}
