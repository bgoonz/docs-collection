## Troubleshooting common resource allocation problems on your appliance

{% note %}

**Note**: Because regularly polling {% data variables.product.product_location %} with continuous integration (CI) or build servers can effectively cause a denial of service attack that results in problems, we recommend using webhooks to push updates. For more information, see "[About webhooks](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/articles/about-webhooks/)".

Use the monitor dashboard to stay informed on your appliance's resource health and make decisions on how to fix high usage issues.

| High CPU usage                   | VM contention from other services or programs running on the same host | If possible, reconfigure other services or programs to use fewer CPU resources. To increase total CPU resources for the VM, see "[Increasing CPU or memory resources](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources/)."                                                                    |
| High memory usage                | VM contention from other services or programs running on the same host | If possible, reconfigure other services or programs to use less memory. To increase the total memory available on the VM, see "[Increasing CPU or memory resources](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources/)."                                                                      |
| Low disk space availability      | Large binaries or log files consuming disk space                       | If possible, host large binaries on a separate server, and compress or archive log files. If necessary, increase disk space on the VM by following the steps for your platform in "[Increasing storage capacity](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/increasing-storage-capacity/)."                                |
| Higher than usual response times | Often caused by one of the above issues                                | Identify and fix the underlying issues. If response times remain high, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_ent_support %}.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Elevated error rates             | Software issues                                                        | Contact {% data variables.contact.contact_ent_support %} and include your support bundle.
