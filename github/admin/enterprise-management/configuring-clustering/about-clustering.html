      {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} is comprised of a set of
      services. In a cluster, these services run across multiple nodes and
      requests are load balanced between them. Changes are automatically stored
      with redundant copies on separate nodes. Most of the services are equal
      peers with other instances of the same service. The exceptions to this are
      the <code>mysql-server</code> and <code>redis-server</code> services.
      These operate with a single <em>primary</em> node with one or more
      <em>replica</em> nodes.

      {% data reusables.enterprise_clustering.clustering-scalability %} However,
      setting up a redundant and scalable cluster can be complex and requires
      careful planning. This additional complexity will need to be planned for
      during installation, disaster recovery scenarios, and upgrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} requires low latency
      between nodes and is not intended for redundancy across geographic
      locations.

      Clustering provides redundancy, but it is not intended to replace a High
      Availability configuration. For more information, see
      <a

        >High Availability configuration</a
      >. A primary/secondary failover configuration is far simpler than
      clustering and will serve the needs of many organizations. For more

      Clustering is designed for specific scaling situations and is not intended
      for every organization. If clustering is something youâ€™d like to consider,
      please contact your dedicated representative or {% data
