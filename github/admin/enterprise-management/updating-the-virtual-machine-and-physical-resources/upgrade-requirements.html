      <strong>Notes:</strong> - To upgrade from {% data
      variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 11.10.348 through {% data
      variables.product.current-340-version %}, you must first migrate to {%
      data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 2.1.23. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/migrating-from-github-enterprise-11-10-x-to-2-1-23"
        >Migrating from {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 11.10.x
        to 2.1.23</a
      >.” - Upgrade packages are available at
      <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/releases">enterprise.github.com</a>
      for supported versions. Verify the availability of the upgrade packages
      you will need to complete the upgrade. If a package is not available,
      contact {% data variables.contact.contact_ent_support %} for assistance. -
      If you’re using {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}
      Clustering, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/clustering/upgrading-a-cluster/"
        >Upgrading a cluster</a
      >” in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} Clustering
      Guide for specific instructions unique to clustering. - The release notes
      for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} provide a
      comprehensive list of new features for every version of {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. For more information, see the
      <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/releases">releases page</a>.

    <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Include as few upgrades as possible in your upgrade process. For
        example, instead of upgrading from {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.supported[2] }} to {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.supported[1] }} to {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.latest }}, you could upgrade from {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.supported[2] }} to {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.latest }}.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re several versions behind, upgrade {% data
        variables.product.product_location %} as far forward as possible with
        each step of your upgrade process. Using the latest version possible on
        each upgrade allows you to take advantage of performance improvements
        and bug fixes. For example, you could upgrade from {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 2.7 to 2.8 to 2.10, but
        upgrading from {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 2.7 to
        2.9 to 2.10 uses a later version in the second step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the latest patch release when upgrading. {% data
        reusables.enterprise_installation.enterprise-download-upgrade-pkg %}
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a staging instance to test the upgrade steps. For more information,
        see “<a
          href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/setting-up-a-staging-instance/"
          >Setting up a staging instance</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        When running multiple upgrades, wait at least 24 hours between feature
        upgrades to allow data migrations and upgrade tasks running in the
        background to fully complete.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You must upgrade from a feature release that’s
        <strong>at most</strong> two releases behind. For example, to upgrade to
        {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.latest }}, you must be on {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.supported[1] }} or {{
        enterpriseServerReleases.supported[2] }}.
      </li>
      <li>
        {% data reusables.enterprise_installation.hotpatching-explanation %}
      </li>
      <li>
        A hotpatch may require downtime if the affected services (like kernel,
        MySQL, or Elasticsearch) require a VM reboot or a service restart.
        You’ll be notified when a reboot or restart is required. You can
        complete the reboot or restart at a later time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional root storage must be available when upgrading through
        hotpatching, as it installs multiple versions of certain services until
        the upgrade is complete. Pre-flight checks will notify you if you don’t
        have enough root disk storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        When upgrading through hotpatching, your instance cannot be too heavily
        loaded, as it may impact the hotpatching process. Pre-flight checks will
        consider the load average and the upgrade will fail if the load average
        is too high.- Upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server
        %} 2.17 migrates your audit logs from Elasticsearch to MySQL. This
        migration also increases the amount of time and disk space it takes to
        restore a snapshot. Before migrating, check the number of bytes in your
        Elasticsearch audit log indices with this command:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>curl -s http://localhost:9201/audit_log/_stats/store | jq ._all.primaries.store.size_in_bytes</code></pre>
    <p>
      Use the number to estimate the amount of disk space the MySQL audit logs
      will need. The script also monitors your free disk space while the import
      is in progress. Monitoring this number is especially useful if your free
      disk space is close to the amount of disk space necessary for migration.
