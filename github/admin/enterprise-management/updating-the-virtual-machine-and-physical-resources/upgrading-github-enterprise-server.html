        If you are upgrading using an upgrade package, schedule a maintenance
        window for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} end users.
        If you are using a hotpatch, maintenance mode is not required.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The maintenance window depends on the type of
      upgrade you perform. Upgrades using a hotpatch usually don’t require a
      maintenance window. Sometimes a reboot is required, which you can perform
      at a later time. Following the versioning scheme of MAJOR.FEATURE.PATCH,
      patch releases using an upgrade package typically require less than five
      minutes of downtime. Feature releases that include data migrations take
      longer depending on storage performance and the amount of data that’s
      migrated. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode"

    <h2 id="taking-a-snapshot">Taking a snapshot</h2>
    <p>
      A snapshot is a checkpoint of a virtual machine (VM) at a point in time.
      We highly recommend taking a snapshot before upgrading your virtual
      machine so that if an upgrade fails, you can revert your VM back to the
      snapshot. If you’re upgrading to a new feature release, you must take a VM
      snapshot. If you’re upgrading to a patch release, you can attach the
      existing data disk.
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of snapshots:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>VM snapshots</strong> save your entire VM state, including user
        data and configuration data. This snapshot method requires a large
        amount of disk space and is time consuming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Data disk snapshots</strong> only save your user data.</p>
        <p>{% note %}</p>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some platforms don’t allow you to take a snapshot of just your data
            disk. For these platforms, you’ll need to take a snapshot of the
            entire VM.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your hypervisor does not support full VM snapshots, you should
            take a snapshot of the root disk and data disk in quick succession.
