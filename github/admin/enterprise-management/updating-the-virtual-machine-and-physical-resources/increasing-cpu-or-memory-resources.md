## Adding CPU or memory resources for AWS

{% note %}

**Note:** To add CPU or memory resources for AWS, you must be familiar with using either the AWS management console or the `aws ec2` command line interface to manage EC2 instances. For background and details on using the AWS tools of your choice to perform the resize, see the AWS documentation on [resizing an Amazon EBS-backed instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html).

{% endnote %}

### Resizing considerations

Before increasing CPU or memory resources for {% data variables.product.product_location %}, review the following recommendations.

- **Scale your memory with CPUs**. {% data reusables.enterprise_installation.increasing-cpus-req %}
- **Assign an Elastic IP address to the instance**. If you haven't assigned an Elastic IP to your instance, you'll have to adjust the DNS A records for your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} host after the restart to account for the change in public IP address. Once your instance restarts, the instance keeps the Elastic IP if you launched the instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC). If you create the instance in an EC2-Classic network, you must manually reassign the Elastic IP to the instance.

### Supported AWS instance types

You need to determine the instance type you would like to upgrade to based on CPU/memory specifications.

### Resizing for AWS

{% note %}

**Note:** For instances launched in EC2-Classic, write down both the Elastic IP address associated with the instance and the instance's ID. Once you restart the instance, re-associate the Elastic IP address.

{% endnote %}

It's not possible to add CPU or memory resources to an existing AWS/EC2 instance. Instead, you must:

1. Stop the instance.
2. Change the instance type.
3. Start the instance.

## Adding CPU or memory resources for OpenStack KVM

It's not possible to add CPU or memory resources to an existing OpenStack KVM instance. Instead, you must:

1. Take a snapshot of the current instance.
2. Stop the instance.
3. Select a new instance flavor that has the desired CPU and/or memory resources.

## Adding CPU or memory resources for VMware

{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.increasing-cpus-req %}

1. Use the vSphere Client to connect to the VMware ESXi host.
2. Shut down {% data variables.product.product_location %}.
3. Select the virtual machine and click **Edit Settings**.
4. Under "Hardware", adjust the CPU and/or memory resources allocated to the virtual machine as needed:

5. To start the virtual machine, click **OK**.
