      Migrations from {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 11.10.348
      and later are supported. Migrating from {% data
      variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 11.10.348 and earlier is not
      supported. You must first upgrade to 11.10.348 in several upgrades. For
      more information, see the 11.10.348 upgrading procedure, “<a
        href="/enterprise/11.10.340/admin/articles/upgrading-to-the-latest-release/"
        >Upgrading to the latest release</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To upgrade to the latest version of {% data
      variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}, you must first migrate to {%
      data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.1, then you can follow the
      normal upgrade process. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/upgrading-github-enterprise-server/"
        >Upgrading {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}</a
      >”.

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Review the Provisioning and Installation guide and check that all
        prerequisites needed to provision and configure {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} 2.1.23 in your environment are
        met. For more information, see “<a
          href="/enterprise/2.1/admin/guides/installation/provisioning-and-installation/"
          >Provisioning and Installation</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Verify that the current instance is running a supported upgrade version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up the latest version of the {% data
        variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}. For more
        information, see
        <a href="https://github.com/github/backup-utils"
          >{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}</a
        >.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have already configured scheduled backups using {% data
            variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}, make sure
            you have updated to the latest version.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are not currently running scheduled backups, set up {% data
            variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Take an initial full backup snapshot of the current instance using the
          <code>ghe-backup</code> command. If you have already configured
          scheduled backups for your current instance, you don’t need to take a
          snapshot of your instance.
        </p>
        <p>{% tip %}</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> You can leave the instance online and in active
          use during the snapshot. You’ll take another snapshot during the
          maintenance portion of the migration. Since backups are incremental,
          this initial snapshot reduces the amount of data transferred in the
          final snapshot, which may shorten the maintenance window.
        </p>
        <p>{% endtip %}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine the method for switching user network traffic to the new
        instance. After you’ve migrated, all HTTP and Git network traffic
        directs to the new instance.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>DNS</strong> - We recommend this method for all
            environments, as it’s simple and works well even when migrating from
            one datacenter to another. Before starting migration, reduce the
            existing DNS record’s TTL to five minutes or less and allow the
            change to propagate. Once the migration is complete, update the DNS
            record(s) to point to the IP address of the new instance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP address assignment</strong> - This method is only
            available on VMware to VMware migration and is not recommended
            unless the DNS method is unavailable. Before starting the migration,
            you’ll need to shut down the old instance and assign its IP address
            to the new instance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Schedule a maintenance window. The maintenance window should include
          enough time to transfer data from the backup host to the new instance
          and will vary based on the size of the backup snapshot and available
          network bandwidth. During this time your current instance will be
          unavailable and in maintenance mode while you migrate to the new
          instance.
