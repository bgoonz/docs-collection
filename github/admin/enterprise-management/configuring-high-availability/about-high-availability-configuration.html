    </header>
    <p>
      When you configure high availability, there is an automated setup of
      one-way, asynchronous replication of all datastores (Git repositories,
      MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch) from the primary to the replica
      appliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} supports an
      active/passive configuration, where the replica appliance runs as a
      standby with database services running in replication mode but application
      services stopped.

      {% data

    </p>
    <p>A high availability configuration is not a good solution for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Scaling-out</strong>. While you can distribute traffic
        geographically using geo-replication, the performance of writes is
        limited to the speed and availability of the primary appliance. For more
        information, see “<a
          href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/about-geo-replication/"
          >About geo-replication</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backing up your primary appliance</strong>. A high availability
        replica does not replace off-site backups in your disaster recovery
        plan. Some forms of data corruption or loss may be replicated
        immediately from the primary to the replica. To ensure safe rollback to
        a stable past state, you must perform regular backups with historical
        snapshots.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zero downtime upgrades</strong>. To prevent data loss and
        split-brain situations in controlled promotion scenarios, place the
        primary appliance in maintenance mode and wait for all writes to
        complete before promoting the replica.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="network-traffic-failover-strategies">
      Network traffic failover strategies
    </h2>
    <p>
      During failover, you must separately configure and manage redirecting
      network traffic from the primary to the replica.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dns-failover">DNS failover</h3>
    <p>
      With DNS failover, use short TTL values in the DNS records that point to
      the primary {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance. We
      recommend a TTL between 60 seconds and five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During failover, you must place the primary into maintenance mode and
      redirect its DNS records to the replica appliance’s IP address. The time
      needed to redirect traffic from primary to replica will depend on the TTL
      configuration and time required to update the DNS records.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using geo-replication, you must configure Geo DNS to direct
      traffic to the nearest replica. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/about-geo-replication/"
        >About geo-replication</a

      {% data reusables.enterprise_clustering.load_balancer_intro %} {% data
      reusables.enterprise_clustering.load_balancer_dns %}
    </p>
    <p>
      During failover, you must place the primary appliance into maintenance
      mode. You can configure the load balancer to automatically detect when the
      replica has been promoted to primary, or it may require a manual
      configuration change. You must manually promote the replica to primary
      before it will respond to user traffic. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/%7B%7B%20currentVersion%20%7D%7D/admin/guides/installation/using-github-enterprise-server-with-a-load-balancer/"

      Utilities for replication management
    </h2>
    <p>
      To manage replication on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %},
      use these command line utilities by connecting to the replica appliance
      using SSH.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ghe-repl-setup">ghe-repl-setup</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>ghe-repl-setup</code> command puts a {% data

      mode.

        An encrypted WireGuard VPN tunnel is configured for communication
        between the two appliances.

      <li>Database services are configured for replication and started.</li>
      <li>
        Application services are disabled. Attempts to access the replica
        appliance over HTTP, Git, or other supported protocols will result in an
        “appliance in replica mode” maintenance page or error message.
