    </header>
    <p>
      Multiple active replicas can provide a shorter distance to the nearest
      replica. For example, an organization with offices in San Francisco, New
      York, and London could run the primary appliance in a datacenter near New
      York and two replicas in datacenters near San Francisco and London. Using
      geolocation-aware DNS, users can be directed to the closest server
      available and access repository data faster. Designating the appliance
      near New York as the primary helps reduce the latency between the hosts,
      compared to the appliance near San Francisco being the primary which has a
      higher latency to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The active replica proxies requests that it can’t process itself to the
      primary instance. The replicas function as a point of presence terminating
      all SSL connections. Traffic between hosts is sent through an encrypted
      VPN connection, similar to a two-node high availability configuration
      without geo-replication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git requests and specific file server requests, such as LFS and file
      uploads, can be served directly from the replica without loading any data
      from the primary. Web requests are always routed to the primary, but if
      the replica is closer to the user the requests are faster due to the
      closer SSL termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geo DNS, such as
      <a
        href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo"
        >Amazon’s Route 53 service</a
      >, is required for geo-replication to work seamlessly. The hostname for
      the instance should resolve to the replica that is closest to the user’s
      location.
    </p>
    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Writing requests to the replica requires sending the data to the primary
      and all replicas. This means that the performance of all writes are
      limited by the slowest replica, although new geo-replicas can seed the
      majority of their data from existing co-located geo-replicas, rather than
      from the primary. Geo-replication will not add capacity to a {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance or solve performance
      issues related to insufficient CPU or memory resources. If the primary
      appliance is offline, active replicas will be unable to serve any read or
      write requests.
