## About spending limits for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

{% data reusables.github-actions.actions-billing %}

{% data reusables.github-actions.actions-spending-limit-brief %}

{% data reusables.actions.actions-packages-set-spending-limit %} For more information about pricing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)."

If you purchased {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, you can connect your Azure Subscription ID to your enterprise account to enable and pay for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage beyond the amounts including with your account. For more information, see "[Connecting an Azure subscription to your enterprise](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/connecting-an-azure-subscription-to-your-enterprise)."

As soon as you set a spending limit other than $0, you will be responsible for any existing overages in the current billing period. For example, if your organization uses {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, does not allow overages, and creates workflow artifacts that increase your storage usage for the month from 1.9GB to 2.1GB, you will use slightly more storage than the 2GB your product includes.

Because you have not enabled overages, your next attempt to create a workflow artifact will fail. You will not receive a bill for the 0.1GB overage that month. However, if you enable overages, your first bill will include the 0.1GB of existing overage for the current billing cycle, as well as any additional overages you accrue.
