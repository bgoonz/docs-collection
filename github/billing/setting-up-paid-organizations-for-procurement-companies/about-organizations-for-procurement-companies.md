To access an organization, each member must sign into their own personal user account.

Organization members can have different roles, such as *owner* or *billing manager*:

- **Owners** have complete administrative access to an organization and its contents.
- **Billing managers** can manage billing settings, and cannot access organization contents. Billing managers are not shown in the list of organization members.

## Payments and pricing for organizations

We don't provide quotes for organization pricing. You can see our published pricing for [organizations](https://github.com/pricing) and [Git Large File Storage](/articles/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage/). We do not provide discounts for procurement companies or for renewal orders.

We accept payment in US dollars, although end users may be located anywhere in the world.

We accept payment by credit card and PayPal. We don't accept payment by purchase order or invoice.

For easier and more efficient purchasing, we recommend that procurement companies set up yearly billing for their clients' organizations.
