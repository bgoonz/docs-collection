    <p>
      To access an organization, each member must sign into their own personal
      user account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organization members can have different roles, such as <em>owner</em> or
      <em>billing manager</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Owners</strong> have complete administrative access to an
        organization and its contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Billing managers</strong> can manage billing settings, and
        cannot access organization contents. Billing managers are not shown in
        the list of organization members.
      </li>
    </ul>

      We accept payment in US dollars, although end users may be located
      anywhere in the world.

      We accept payment by credit card and PayPal. We don’t accept payment by
      purchase order or invoice.
    </p>
