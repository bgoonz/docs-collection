<h2 id="payment-methods-and-billing-cycles-for-data-variables.product.prodname_marketplace-purchases">Payment methods and billing cycles for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchases</h2>
<p>You will have the same payment method for all paid plans and subscriptions across {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.</p>
<p>If your personal account or organization doesn’t have a payment method on file, when you choose a paid plan for an app: - Your billing date is today. - You must add a payment method to your personal account or the organization in which you want to install the app. - Your payment method is charged the full amount of your subscription. - Your receipt is sent to the primary or billing email address on file for your personal account or organization.</p>
<p>If your personal account or organization has an existing payment method, when you choose a paid plan for an app: - The payment method on file is immediately charged a prorated amount based on the time remaining until your next billing date. - The monthly or yearly billing date for your app subscription is the same as the account or organization’s regular billing date. - On your next billing date, your receipt lists charges for your paid {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan and your app subscription.</p>
<p>When you choose a paid plan with a free trial: - You must have an existing payment method or add a new payment method for your personal account or the organization in which you want to install the app. - If you don’t have any other paid plans or subscriptions, you are charged the full amount of your subscription at the end of the 14-day free trial. - If you have other paid plans or subscriptions, once your 14-day free trial ends, the payment method on file is immediately charged a prorated amount based on the time remaining until your next billing date. - If you have other paid plans or subscriptions, on your next billing date, your receipt lists charges for your paid {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan and your app subscription.</p>

<h2 id="unit-plan-limits">Unit plan limits</h2>
<p>If you choose a unit plan (for example, a plan that charges per user), and you exceed the units that you’re paying for, the integrator may disable your access until you upgrade the app. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/upgrading-the-billing-plan-for-a-github-marketplace-app">Upgrading the billing plan for a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} app</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="downgrading-a-data-variables.product.prodname_marketplace-app">Downgrading a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} app</h2>
<p>If you downgrade your app subscription to a less expensive plan or if you cancel a paid app subscription, your changes will take effect at the end your current billing cycle. Your subscription will be moved to your new plan on your next billing date.</p>
<p>If you cancel an app on a free plan, your subscription will immediately end and you’ll lose access to the app.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.marketplace.downgrade-marketplace-only %}</p>
<p>If you cancel a free trial on a paid plan, your subscription is immediately canceled and you will lose access to the app. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/canceling-a-github-marketplace-app">Canceling a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} app</a>.”</p>
