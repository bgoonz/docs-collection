## About billing for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}

{% data reusables.large_files.free-storage-bandwidth-amount %} {% data reusables.large_files.does_not_carry %}

{% data reusables.large_files.owner_quota_only %}

{% data reusables.user_settings.context_switcher %}

## Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth

Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_price %}, and provides a monthly quota of {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_bandwidth %} for bandwidth and {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_storage %} for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs.

Purchasing data packs for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} is independent of any other paid feature or product on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

## Downgrading storage and bandwidth

If you downgrade your number of additional data packs, your changes will take effect on your next billing date.
