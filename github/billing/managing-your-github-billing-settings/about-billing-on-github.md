## Paid features and products

You can upgrade your personal account or organization to a paid subscription at any time. You can also choose to purchase apps from {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} or upgrade storage and bandwidth for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}. For more information, see:
- "[About billing for {% data variables.product.product_name %} accounts](/articles/about-billing-for-github-accounts)"
- "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](/articles/about-billing-for-github-marketplace)"
- "[About billing for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}](/articles/about-billing-for-git-large-file-storage)"
- "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}](/articles/about-billing-for-github-sponsors)"

## Managing billing settings

You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your accounts separately. You can choose to pay monthly or yearly for each account's paid products and features. Every paid feature or product associated with an account shares a billing date, payment method, and receipt.

{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.payment-methods %} {% data reusables.dotcom_billing.same-payment-method %}

For more information, see "[Managing your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} billing settings](/articles/managing-your-github-billing-settings)."

## Switching between settings for your different accounts

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
1. At the top of the page, to the right of your username, click **Switch to another account**.
