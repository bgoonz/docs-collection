You can cancel pending changes to your account's subscription as well as pending changes to your subscriptions to other paid features and products.

When you cancel a pending change, your subscription will not change on your next billing date (unless you make a subsequent change to your subscription before your next billing date).

## Viewing and managing pending changes to your personal account's subscription

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.billing_plans %}
{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.review-pending-changes %}
{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.cancel-pending-changes %}
{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.confirm-cancel-pending-changes %}

## Viewing and managing pending changes to your organization's subscription
