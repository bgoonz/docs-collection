<p>New organizations can build public and open-source projects with {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %}, or <a href="%7B%%20data%20variables.product.pricing_url%20%%7D">upgrade</a> to a paid product with per-user pricing.</p>
<p>Organizations using a paid subscription before May 11, 2016 can choose to stay on their existing per-repository plan or switch to per-user pricing. We will notify you twelve months before any mandated change to your subscription. For more information on switching your subscription, see “<a href="/articles/upgrading-your-github-subscription">Upgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} subscription</a>.”</p>
<p>For more information on products with per-user pricing, see “<a href="/articles/githubs-products">{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}’s products</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="how-many-licenses-do-i-need-for-my-organization">How many licenses do I need for my organization?</h2>
<p>Organization owners and members each fill a license. If you’ve sent a pending invitation to a prospective organization member, the invitation will fill a license. {% data reusables.organizations.org-invite-expiration %}</p>
<p>Outside collaborators and bot accounts will count toward your organization’s total of paid licenses if they are given access to a private repository.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-add-or-downgrade-my-organizations-paid-licenses">How can I add or downgrade my organization’s paid licenses?</h2>
<p>You can add paid licenses to your organization anytime. If you’re paying for more licenses than you’re using, you can also remove paid licenses from your organization. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/upgrading-your-github-subscription">Upgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} subscription</a>” and “<a href="/articles/downgrading-your-github-subscription">Downgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} subscription</a>.”</p>
<p>If you have questions about your organization’s subscription, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-keep-my-organization-on-a-per-repository-plan-can-i-upgrade-or-downgrade-to-a-different-per-repository-plan">If I keep my organization on a per-repository plan, can I upgrade or downgrade to a different per-repository plan?</h2>
<p>You can upgrade or downgrade between legacy paid plans in your organization’s billing settings. When you upgrade to a plan with more private repositories, we’ll immediately move your account to your new plan and bill you for the difference in price, prorated for the number of days left in your billing cycle.</p>
<p>When you downgrade to a legacy paid plan with fewer private repositories, your new plan will take effect on your next billing date. If you have more private repositories than your new plan allows for, your private repositories will be locked when your new plan takes effect. To reduce your number of private repositories, you can make some of your private repositories public, or you can clone your private repositories locally and delete the copies on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.</p>
