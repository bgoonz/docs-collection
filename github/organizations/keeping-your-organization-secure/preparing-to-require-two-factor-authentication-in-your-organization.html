    <p>
      We recommend that you notify {% ifversion fpt %}organization members,
      outside collaborators, and billing managers{% else %}organization members
      and outside collaborators{% endif %} at least one week before you require
      2FA in your organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you require use of two-factor authentication for your organization,
      members, outside collaborators, and billing managers (including bot
      accounts) who do not use 2FA will be removed from the organization and
      lose access to its repositories. They will also lose access to their forks
      of the organizationâ€™s private repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before requiring 2FA in your organization, we recommend that you: -
      <a
        href="/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/"
        >Enable 2FA</a
      >
      on your personal account - Ask the people in your organization to set up
      2FA for their accounts - See whether
      <a
        href="/articles/viewing-whether-users-in-your-organization-have-2fa-enabled/"
        >users in your organization have 2FA enabled</a
      >
      - Warn users that once 2FA is enabled, those without 2FA are automatically
      removed from the organization
