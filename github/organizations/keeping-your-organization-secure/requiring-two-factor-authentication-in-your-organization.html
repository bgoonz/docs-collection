      <li>
        When you require use of two-factor authentication for your organization,
        {% ifversion fpt %}members, outside collaborators, and billing
        managers{% else %}members and outside collaborators{% endif %}
        (including bot accounts) who do not use 2FA will be removed from the
        organization and lose access to its repositories. They will also lose
        access to their forks of the organization’s private repositories. You
        can
        <a href="/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization"
          >reinstate their access privileges and settings</a
        >
        if they enable two-factor authentication for their personal account
        within three months of their removal from your organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an organization owner, member,{% ifversion fpt %} billing manager,{%
        endif %} or outside collaborator disables 2FA for their personal account
        after you’ve enabled required two-factor authentication, they will
        automatically be removed from the organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re the sole owner of an organization that requires two-factor
        authentication, you won’t be able to disable 2FA for your personal
        account without disabling required two-factor authentication for the
        organization.

    <p>
      Before you can require {% ifversion fpt %}organization members, outside
      collaborators, and billing managers{% else %}organization members and
      outside collaborators{% endif %} to use two-factor authentication, you
      must enable two-factor authentication for your account on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa"
        >Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you require use of two-factor authentication, we recommend
      notifying {% ifversion fpt %}organization members, outside collaborators,
      and billing managers{% else %}organization members and outside
      collaborators{% endif %} and asking them to set up 2FA for their accounts.
      You can see if members and outside collaborators already use 2FA. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/viewing-whether-users-in-your-organization-have-2fa-enabled"
        >Viewing whether users in your organization have 2FA enabled</a

        >search your organization’s audit log</a

    <p>
      If any members or outside collaborators are removed from the organization
      when you enable required use of two-factor authentication, they’ll receive
      an email notifying them that they’ve been removed. They should then enable
      2FA for their personal account, and contact an organization owner to
      request access to your organization.
