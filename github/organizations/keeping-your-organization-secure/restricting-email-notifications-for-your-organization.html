    <p>
      When restricted email notifications are enabled in an organization,
      members can only use an email address associated with a verified or
      approved domain to receive email notifications about organization
      activity.

        href="/organizations/managing-organization-settings/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-organization"
        >Verifying or approving a domain for your organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.notifications.email-restrictions-verification %}</p>
    <p>
      Outside collaborators are not subject to restrictions on email
      notifications for verified or approved domains. For more information about
      outside collaborators, see “<a

        >Permission levels for an organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If your organization is owned by an enterprise account, organization
      members will be able to receive notifications from any domains verified or
      approved for the enterprise account, in addition to any domains verified
      or approved for the organization. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise-account"

      >.”

      Before you can restrict email notifications for your organization, you
      must verify or approve at least one domain for the organization, or an
      enterprise owner must have verified or approved at least one domain for
      the enterprise account.
    </p>
