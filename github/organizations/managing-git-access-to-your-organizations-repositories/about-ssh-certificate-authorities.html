    </header>
    <p>
      An SSH certificate is a mechanism for one SSH key to sign another SSH key.
      If you use an SSH certificate authority (CA) to provide your organization
      members with signed SSH certificates, you can add the CA to your
      enterprise account or organization to allow organization members to use
      their certificates to access organization resources. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/articles/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities"
        >Managing your organization’s SSH certificate authorities</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After you add an SSH CA to your organization or enterprise account, you
      can use the CA to sign client SSH certificates for organization members.
      Organization members can use the signed certificates to access your
      organization’s repositories (and only your organization’s repositories)
      with Git. You can require that members use SSH certificates to access
      organization resources.{% ifversion fpt %} For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/enforcing-security-settings-in-your-enterprise-account#managing-your-enterprise-accounts-ssh-certificate-authorities"
        >Enforcing security settings in your enterprise account</a
      >.”{% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you can build an internal system that issues a new
      certificate to your developers every morning. Each developer can use their
      daily certificate to work on your organization’s repositories on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}. At the end of the day, the certificate
      can automatically expire, protecting your repositories if the certificate
      is later compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you issue each certificate, you must include an extension that
      specifies which {% data variables.product.product_name %} user the
      certificate is for. For example, you can use OpenSSH’s
      <code>ssh-keygen</code> command, replacing <em>KEY-IDENTITY</em> with your
      key identity and <em>USERNAME</em> with a {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} username.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ ssh-keygen -s ./ca-key -I &lt;em&gt;KEY-IDENTITY&lt;/em&gt; -O extension:login@{% data variables.product.product_url %}=&lt;em&gt;USERNAME&lt;/em&gt; ./user-key.pub</code></pre>
    <p>
      To issue a certificate for someone who uses SSH to access multiple {% data
      variables.product.company_short %} products, you can include two login
      extensions to specify the username for each product. For example, the
      following command would issue a certificate for <em>USERNAME-1</em> for
      the user’s account for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %},
      and <em>USERNAME-2</em> for the user’s account on {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} or {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} at <em>HOSTNAME</em>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ ssh-keygen -s ./ca-key -I &lt;em&gt;KEY-IDENTITY&lt;/em&gt; -O extension:login@github.com=&lt;em&gt;USERNAME-1&lt;/em&gt; extension:login@&lt;em&gt;HOSTNAME&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;USERNAME-2&lt;/em&gt; ./user-key.pub</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can restrict the IP addresses from which an organization member can
      access your organization’s resources by using a
      <code>source-address</code> extension. The extension accepts a specific IP
      address or a range of IP addresses using CIDR notation. You can specify
      multiple addresses or ranges by separating the values with commas. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation"
        >Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a
      >” on Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ ssh-keygen -s ./ca-key -I &lt;em&gt;KEY-IDENTITY&lt;/em&gt; -O extension:login@{% data variables.product.product_url %}=&lt;em&gt;USERNAME&lt;/em&gt; -O source-address=&lt;em&gt;COMMA-SEPARATED-LIST-OF-IP-ADDRESSES-OR-RANGES&lt;/em&gt; ./user-key.pub</code></pre>
    <p>{% ifversion fpt %}</p>
    <p>
      Organization members can use their signed certificates for authentication
      even if you’ve enforced SAML single sign-on. Unless you make SSH
      certificates a requirement, organization members can continue to use other
      means of authentication to access your organization’s resources with Git,
      including their username and password, personal access tokens, and their
      own SSH keys.
    </p>
    <p>{% endif %}</p>
    <p>
      To prevent authentication errors, organization members should use a
      special URL that includes the organization ID to clone repositories using
      signed certificates. Anyone with read access to the repository can find
      this URL on the repository page. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/cloning-a-repository"
        >Cloning a repository</a
      >.”
