Organization owners can manage an organization's SSH certificate authorities (CA).

You can allow members to access your organization's repositories using SSH certificates you provide by adding an SSH CA to your organization. {% data reusables.organizations.can-require-ssh-cert %} For more information, see "[About SSH certificate authorities](/articles/about-ssh-certificate-authorities)."
