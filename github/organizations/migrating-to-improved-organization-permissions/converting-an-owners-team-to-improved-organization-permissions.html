</header>
<p>You have a few options to convert your legacy Owners team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the team a new name that denotes the members have a special status in the organization.</li>
<li>Delete the team after ensuring all members have been added to teams that grant necessary access to the organization’s repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="give-the-owners-team-a-new-name">Give the Owners team a new name</h2>
<p>{% tip %}</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because “admin” is a term for organization members with specific <a href="/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization">access to certain repositories</a> in the organization, we recommend you avoid that term in any team name you decide on.</p>

In the team name field, choose a new name for the Owners team. For example: - If very few members of your organization were members of the Owners team, you might name the team “Core”. - If all members of your organization were members of the Owners team so that they could <span class="citation" data-cites="mention">[@mention teams]</span>(/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams), you might name the team “Employees”. <img src="/assets/images/help/teams/owners-team-new-name.png" alt="The team name field, with the Owners team renamed to Core" /> 6. Under the team description, click <strong>Save and continue</strong>. <img src="/assets/images/help/teams/owners-team-save-and-continue.png" alt="The Save and continue button" /> 7. Optionally, <a href="/articles/changing-team-visibility">make the team <em>public</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If there are members of your Owners team who are not members of other teams, deleting the team will remove those members from the organization. Before deleting the team, ensure members are already direct members of the organization, or have collaborator access to necessary repositories.</p>
