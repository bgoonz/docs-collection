    <p>
      By default, all organization members can create repositories. If you
      restrict
      <a href="/articles/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization"
        >repository creation permissions</a
      >
      to organization owners, and your organization was created under the legacy
      organization permissions structure, members of legacy admin teams will
      still be able to create repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legacy admin teams are teams that were created with the admin permission
      level under the legacy organization permissions structure. Members of
      these teams were able to create repositories for the organization, and
      we’ve preserved this ability in the improved organization permissions
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove this ability by migrating your legacy admin teams to the
      improved organization permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization"
        >Repository permission levels for an organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> If your organization has disabled
      <a href="/articles/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization"
        >repository creation permissions</a
      >
      for all members, some members of legacy admin teams may lose repository
      creation permissions. If your organization has enabled member repository
      creation, migrating legacy admin teams to improved organization
      permissions will not affect team members’ ability to create repositories.
