## Notifications for team discussions

When someone posts or replies to a public discussion on a team's page, members of the team and members of any child teams receive email or web notifications. When someone posts or replies to a private discussion on a team's page, only members of the team receive notifications.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** Depending on your notification settings, you'll receive updates by email, the web notifications page on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or both. For more information, see {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}"[Configuring notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications){% else %}"[About email notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-email-notifications)" and "[About web notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-web-notifications){% endif %}."

{% endtip %}

By default, if your username is mentioned in a team discussion, you'll receive notifications for the post mentioning your username and any replies to that post. Also, by default, if you reply to a post, you will receive notifications for other replies to the post.

To turn off notifications for team discussions, you can unsubscribe to a specific discussion post or change your notification settings to unwatch or completely ignore a specific team's discussions. You can subscribe to notifications for a specific discussion post even if you're unwatching that team's discussions.

For more information, see {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %}"[Viewing your subscriptions](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions){% else %}"[Subscribing to and unsubscribing from notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/subscribing-to-and-unsubscribing-from-notifications){% endif %}" and "[Nested teams](/articles/about-teams/#nested-teams)."
