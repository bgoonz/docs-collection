<p>By default, issues cannot be deleted in an organization’s repositories. An organization owner must enable this feature for all of the organization’s repositories first.</p>
<p>Once enabled, organization owners and people with admin permissions in an organization-owned repository can delete issues. People with admin permissions in a repository include organization members and outside collaborators with admin privileges. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/">Repository permission levels for an organization</a>” and “<a href="/articles/deleting-an-issue">Deleting an issue</a>.”</p>
