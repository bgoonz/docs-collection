You can choose whether members can create repositories in your organization. If you allow members to create repositories, you can choose which types of repositories members can create.{% ifversion fpt %} To allow members to create private repositories only, your organization must use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.{% endif %} For more information, see "[About repository visibility](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility)."

Organization owners can always create any type of repository.

{% ifversion fpt %}Enterprise owners{% else %}Site administrators{% endif %} can restrict the options you have available for your organization's repository creation policy. For more information, see {% ifversion fpt %}"[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise-account)."{% else %}"[Restricting repository creation in your enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#setting-a-policy-for-repository-creation)."{% endif %}

{% warning %}

**Warning**: This setting only restricts the visibility options available when repositories are created and does not restrict the ability to change repository visibility at a later time. For more information about restricting changes to existing repositories' visibilities, see "[Restricting repository visibility changes in your organization](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-visibility-changes-in-your-organization)."
