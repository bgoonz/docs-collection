      What happens when I change my organization’s name?
    </h2>
    <p>
      After changing your organization’s name, your old organization name
      becomes available for someone else to claim. When you change your
      organization’s name, most references to your repositories under the old
      organization name automatically change to the new name. However, some
      links to your profile won’t automatically redirect.
    </p>
    <h3 id="changes-that-occur-automatically">
      Changes that occur automatically
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically redirects
        references to your repositories. Web links to your organization’s
        existing <strong>repositories</strong> will continue to work. This can
        take a few minutes to complete after you initiate the change.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can continue pushing your local repositories to the old remote
        tracking URL without updating it. However, we recommend you update all
        existing remote repository URLs after changing your organization name.
        Because your old organization name is available for use by anyone else
        after you change it, the new organization owner can create repositories
        that override the redirect entries to your repository. For more
        information, see “<a
          href="/github/getting-started-with-github/managing-remote-repositories"
          >Managing remote repositories</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Previous Git commits will also be correctly attributed to users within
        your organization.

      After changing your organization’s name: - Links to your previous
      organization profile page, such as
      <code
        >https://{% data variables.command_line.backticks
        %}/previousorgname</code
      >, will return a 404 error. We recommend you update links to your
      organization from other sites{% ifversion fpt %}, such as your LinkedIn or
      Twitter profiles{% endif %}. - API requests that use the old
      organization’s name will return a 404 error. We recommend you update the
      old organization name in your API requests. - There are no automatic
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mention">[@mention]</span
      >(/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams)
      redirects for teams that use the old organization’s name.{% ifversion fpt
      %} - If SAML single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for the organization, you
      must update the organization name in the application for {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} on your identity provider (IdP).
      If you don’t update the organization name on your IdP, members of the
      organization will no longer be able to authenticate with your IdP to
      access the organization’s resources. For more information, see “<a
