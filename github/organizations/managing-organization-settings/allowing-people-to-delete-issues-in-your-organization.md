shortTitle: Allow issue deletion
---

By default, issues cannot be deleted in an organization's repositories. An organization owner must enable this feature for all of the organization's repositories first.

Once enabled, organization owners and people with admin permissions in an organization-owned repository can delete issues. People with admin permissions in a repository include organization members and outside collaborators with admin privileges. For more information, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)" and "[Deleting an issue](/articles/deleting-an-issue)."
