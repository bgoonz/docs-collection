An organization's news feed shows other people's activity on repositories owned by that organization. You can use your organization's news feed to see when someone opens, closes, or merges an issue or pull request, creates or deletes a branch, creates a tag or release, comments on an issue, pull request, or commit, or pushes new commits to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

## Accessing your organization's news feed

1. {% data variables.product.signin_link %} to your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.
2. Open your {% data reusables.user_settings.personal_dashboard %}.
3. Click the account context switcher in the upper-left corner of the page.
