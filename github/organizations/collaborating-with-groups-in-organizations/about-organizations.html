    <p>
      Enterprise accounts allow owners to centrally manage policy and billing
      for multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}
      organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For organizations that belong to an enterprise account, billing is managed
      at the enterprise account level, and billing settings are not available at
      the organization level. Enterprise owners can set policy for all
      organizations in the enterprise account or allow organization owners to
      set the policy at the organization level. Organization owners cannot
      change settings enforced for your organization at the enterprise account
      level. If you have questions about a policy or setting for your
      organization, contact the owner of your enterprise account.
