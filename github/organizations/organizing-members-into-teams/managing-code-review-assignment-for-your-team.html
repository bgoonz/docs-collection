      Team maintainers and organization owners can configure code review
      assignments.

    <h2 id="about-code-review-assignments">About code review assignments</h2>
    <p>
      By using code review assignments, any time your team has been requested to
      review a pull request, the team is removed as a reviewer and a specified
      subset of team members are assigned in the team’s place. Code review
      assignments allow you to decide whether the whole team or just a subset of
      team members are notified when a team is requested for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      When code owners are automatically requested for review, the team is still
      removed and replaced with individuals. The individual approvals don’t
      satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners"
        >About code owners</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="routing-algorithms">Routing algorithms</h2>
    <p>
      Code review assignments automatically choose and assign reviewers based on
      one of two possible algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round robin algorithm chooses reviewers based on who’s received the
      least recent review request, focusing on alternating between all members
      of the team regardless of the number of outstanding reviews they currently
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The load balance algorithm chooses reviewers based on each member’s total
      number of recent review requests and considers the number of outstanding
      reviews for each member. The load balance algorithm tries to ensure that
      each team member reviews an equal number of pull requests in any 30 day
      period.
