Organization owners can change the parent of any team. Team maintainers can change a team's parent if they are maintainers in both the child team and the parent team. Team maintainers without maintainer permissions in the child team can request to add a parent or child team. For more information, see "[Requesting to add or change a parent team](/articles/requesting-to-add-or-change-a-parent-team)" and "[Requesting to add a child team](/articles/requesting-to-add-a-child-team)."

{% data reusables.organizations.child-team-inherits-permissions %}

{% tip %}

**Tips:**
- You cannot change a team's parent to a secret team. For more information, see "[About teams](/articles/about-teams)."
- You cannot nest a parent team beneath one of its child teams.
