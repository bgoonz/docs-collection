      Organization owners and team maintainers can give teams admin, read, or
      write access to organization repositories. Organization members can send a
      notification to an entire team by mentioning the team’s name. Organization
      members can also send a notification to an entire team by requesting a
      review from that team. Organization members can request reviews from
      specific teams with read access to the repository where the pull request
      is opened. Teams can be designated as owners of certain types or areas of
      code in a CODEOWNERS file.

      You can also use LDAP Sync to synchronize {% data
      variables.product.product_location %} team members and team roles against
      your established LDAP groups. This lets you establish role-based access
      control for users from your LDAP server instead of manually within {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}. For more information, see “<a
        href="/enterprise/admin/authentication/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync"
        >Enabling LDAP Sync</a

      Each team has its own page within an organization. On a team’s page, you
      can view team members, child teams, and the team’s repositories.
      Organization owners and team maintainers can access team settings and
      update the team’s description and profile picture from the team’s page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organization members can create and participate in discussions with the
      team. For more information, see “<a

        >About team discussions</a

    <h2 id="nested-teams">Nested teams</h2>
    <p>
      You can reflect your group or company’s hierarchy within your {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} organization with multiple levels of
      nested teams. A parent team can have multiple child teams, while each
      child team only has one parent team. You cannot nest secret teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Child teams inherit the parent’s access permissions, simplifying
      permissions management for large groups. Members of child teams also
      receive notifications when the parent team is
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentioned">@mentioned</span>,
      simplifying communication with multiple groups of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if your team structure is Employees &gt; Engineering &gt;
      Application Engineering &gt; Identity, granting Engineering write access
      to a repository means Application Engineering and Identity also get that
      access. If you
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mention">@mention</span> the Identity
      Team or any team at the bottom of the organization hierarchy, they’re the
      only ones who will receive a notification.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      To easily understand who shares a parent team’s permissions and mentions,
      you can see all of the members of a parent team’s child teams on the
      Members tab of the parent team’s page. Members of a child team are not
      direct members of the parent team.

    <p>
      You can choose a parent when you create the team, or you can move a team
      in your organization’s hierarchy later. For more information see, “<a
        href="/articles/moving-a-team-in-your-organization-s-hierarchy"
        >Moving a team in your organization’s hierarchy</a

      Preparing to nest teams in your organization
    </h2>
    <p>
      If your organization already has existing teams, you should audit each
      team’s repository access permissions before you nest teams above or below
      it. You should also consider the new structure you’d like to implement for
      your organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the team hierarchy, you should give parent teams repository
      access permissions that are safe for every member of the parent team and
      its child teams. As you move toward the bottom of the hierarchy, you can
      grant child teams additional, more granular access to more sensitive
      repositories.
