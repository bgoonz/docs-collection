Team maintainers and organization owners can configure code review assignments.

## About code review assignments

By using code review assignments, any time your team has been requested to review a pull request, the team is removed as a reviewer and a specified subset of team members are assigned in the team's place. Code review assignments allow you to decide whether the whole team or just a subset of team members are notified when a team is requested for review.

When code owners are automatically requested for review, the team is still removed and replaced with individuals. The individual approvals don't satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see "[About code owners](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners)."

## Routing algorithms

Code review assignments automatically choose and assign reviewers based on one of two possible algorithms. 

The round robin algorithm chooses reviewers based on who's received the least recent review request, focusing on alternating between all members of the team regardless of the number of outstanding reviews they currently have. 

The load balance algorithm chooses reviewers based on each member's total number of recent review requests and considers the number of outstanding reviews for each member. The load balance algorithm tries to ensure that each team member reviews an equal number of pull requests in any 30 day period.
