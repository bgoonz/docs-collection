<p><strong>Warnings:</strong> - You can change a team’s permission level if the team has direct access to a project board. If the team’s access to the project board is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team’s access to the project board. - If you add or remove project board access for a parent team, each of that parent’s child teams will also receive or lose access to the project board. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/about-teams">About teams</a>.”</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> {% data reusables.project-management.cascading-permissions %} For example, if an organization owner has given a team read permissions to a project board, and a project board admin gives one of the team members admin permissions to that board as an individual collaborator, that person would have admin permissions to the project board.
