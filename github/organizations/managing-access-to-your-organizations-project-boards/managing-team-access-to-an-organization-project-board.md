{% warning %}

**Warnings:**
- You can change a team's permission level if the team has direct access to a project board. If the team's access to the project board is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team's access to the project board.
- If you add or remove project board access for a parent team, each of that parent's child teams will also receive or lose access to the project board. For more information, see "[About teams](/articles/about-teams)."

{% endwarning %}

## Giving a team access to a project board

You can give an entire team the same permission level to a project board.

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.project-management.cascading-permissions %} For example, if an organization owner has given a team read permissions to a project board, and a project board admin gives one of the team members admin permissions to that board as an individual collaborator, that person would have admin permissions to the project board. For more information see, "[Project board permissions for an organization](/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

## Configuring a team's access to a project board

If a team's access to a project board is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team's access to the project board to update access to the child teams.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.specific_team %}
4. Above the team's conversation, click {% octicon "project" aria-label="The Projects icon" %} **Projects**.
