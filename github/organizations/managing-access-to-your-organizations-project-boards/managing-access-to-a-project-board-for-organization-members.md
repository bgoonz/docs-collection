By default, organization members have write access to their organization's project boards unless organization owners or project board admins set different permissions for specific project boards.

## Setting a baseline permission level for all organization members

{% tip %}

**Tip:** You can give an organization member higher permissions to project board. For more information, see "[Project board permissions for an organization](/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

{% endtip %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.organization-wide-project %}
{% data reusables.project-management.select-project %}
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
{% data reusables.project-management.access-collaboration-settings %}
8. Under "Organization member permission", choose a baseline permission level for all organization members: **Read**, **Write**, **Admin**, or **None**.
