<h2 id="permissions-overview">Permissions overview</h2>
<p>There are three levels of permissions to a project board for people and teams:</p>
<p>{% data reusables.project-management.project-board-permissions %}</p>
<p>Organization owners and people with admin permissions can give a person access to an organization project board individually, as an outside collaborator or organization member, or through their membership in a team or organization. An outside collaborator is someone who is not an organization member but given permissions to collaborate in your organization.</p>
<p>Organization owners and people with admin permissions to a project board can also: - Set default project board permissions for all organization members. - Manage access to the project board for organization members, teams, and outside collaborators. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-project-board">Managing team access to an organization project board</a>”, “<a href="/articles/managing-an-individual-s-access-to-an-organization-project-board">Managing an individual’s access to an organization project board</a>”, or “<a href="/articles/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members">Managing access to a project board for organization members</a>.” - Manage project board visibility. For more information, see “<a href="/articles/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members">Managing access to a project board for organization members</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="cascading-permissions-for-project-boards">Cascading permissions for project boards</h2>
<p>{% data reusables.project-management.cascading-permissions %}</p>
<p>For example, if an organization owner has given all organization members read permissions to a project board, and a project board admin gives an organization member write permissions to that board as an individual collaborator, that person would have write permissions to the project board.</p>
<h2 id="project-board-visibility">Project board visibility</h2>
<p>{% data reusables.project-management.project-board-visibility %} You can change the project board’s visibility from private to {% ifversion ghae %}internal{% else %}public{% endif %} and back again.
