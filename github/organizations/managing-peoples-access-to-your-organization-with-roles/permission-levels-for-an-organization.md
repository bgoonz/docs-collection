## Permission levels for an organization

Organization members can have *owner*{% ifversion fpt %}, *billing manager*,{% endif %} or *member* roles:

- **Owners** have complete administrative access to your organization. This role should be limited, but to no less than two people, in your organization. For more information, see "[Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization)."
{% ifversion fpt %}
- **Billing managers** allow a person to manage billing settings. For more information, see "[Adding a billing manager to your organization](/articles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization)".
{% endif %}
- **Members** are the default role for everyone else.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} managers

By default, only organization owners can manage the settings of {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by an organization. To allow additional users to manage {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by an organization, an owner can grant them {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager permissions.

When you designate a user as a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager in your organization, you can grant them access to manage the settings of some or all {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by the organization. For more information, see:

- "[Adding GitHub App managers in your organization](/articles/adding-github-app-managers-in-your-organization)"
- "[Removing GitHub App managers from your organization](/articles/removing-github-app-managers-from-your-organization)"

## Outside collaborators

To keep your organization's data secure while allowing access to repositories, you can add *outside collaborators*. {% data reusables.organizations.outside_collaborators_description %}
