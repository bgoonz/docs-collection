Members of your organization's Owners team can give *billing manager* permissions to people. Once a person accepts their invitation to become a billing manager for your organization, they can invite additional people to be billing managers.

{% note %}

**Note:** Billing managers do not use paid licenses in your organization's subscription.

{% endnote %}

## Permissions for billing managers

Billing managers can:

- Upgrade or downgrade the account
- Add, update, or remove payment methods
- View payment history
- Download receipts
- View, invite, and remove billing managers
- Start, modify, or cancel sponsorships

In addition, all billing managers will receive billing receipts by email on the organization's billing date.

Billing managers **are not** able to:

- Create or access repositories in your organizations
- See private members of your organization
- Be seen in the list of organization members
- Purchase, edit, or cancel subscriptions for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} apps

{% tip %}

**Tip:**  If your organization [requires members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to use two-factor authentication](/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization), the user must enable two-factor authentication before they can accept your invitation to become a billing manager for the organization.

{% endtip %}

## Inviting a billing manager

The invited person will receive an invitation email asking them to become a billing manager for your organization. Once the invited person clicks the accept link in their invitation email, they will automatically be added to the organization as a billing manager. If they don't already have a GitHub account, they will be directed to sign up for one, and they will be automatically added to the organization as a billing manager after they create an account.
