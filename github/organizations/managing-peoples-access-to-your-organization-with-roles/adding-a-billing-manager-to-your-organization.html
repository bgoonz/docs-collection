      Members of your organization’s Owners team can give
      <em>billing manager</em> permissions to people. Once a person accepts
      their invitation to become a billing manager for your organization, they
      can invite additional people to be billing managers.

      organization’s subscription.

        >requires members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to use
        two-factor authentication</a

    <h2 id="inviting-a-billing-manager">Inviting a billing manager</h2>
    <p>
      The invited person will receive an invitation email asking them to become
      a billing manager for your organization. Once the invited person clicks
      the accept link in their invitation email, they will automatically be
      added to the organization as a billing manager. If they don’t already have
      a GitHub account, they will be directed to sign up for one, and they will
      be automatically added to the organization as a billing manager after they
      create an account.
