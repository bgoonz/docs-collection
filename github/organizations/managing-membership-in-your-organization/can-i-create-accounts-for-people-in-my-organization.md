shortTitle: Create accounts for people
---

Because you access an organization by logging in to a personal account, each of your team members needs a personal account. Once you have user names for each person you'd like to add to your organization, you can add them to teams.

## Adding users to your organization

1. Provide each person instructions to [create a personal account](/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).
2. Ask for the username of each person you want to give organization membership to.
3. [Invite the new personal accounts to join](/articles/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization) your organization. Use [organization roles](/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization) and [repository permissions](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) to limit the access of each account.
