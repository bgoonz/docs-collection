{% tip %}

**Tips**:
- If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can invite a new member to join the organization or reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see "[About per-user pricing](/articles/about-per-user-pricing)." {% data reusables.organizations.org-invite-expiration %}
- If your organization requires members to use two-factor authentication, users that you invite must enable two-factor authentication before accepting the invitation. For more information, see "[Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)" and "[Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)](/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)."
