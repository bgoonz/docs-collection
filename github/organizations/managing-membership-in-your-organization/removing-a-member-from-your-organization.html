      <strong>Warning:</strong> When you remove members from an organization: -
      The paid license count does not automatically downgrade. To pay for fewer
      licenses after removing users from your organization, follow the steps in
      “<a href="/articles/downgrading-your-organization-s-paid-seats"
        >Downgrading your organization’s paid seats</a
      >.” - Removed members will lose access to private forks of your
      organization’s private repositories, but they may still have local copies.
      However, they cannot sync local copies with your organization’s
      repositories. Their private forks can be restored if the user is
      <a href="/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization"
        >reinstated as an organization member</a
      >
      within three months of being removed from the organization. Ultimately,
      you are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a
      repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property. -
      Any organization invitations sent by a removed member, that have not been
      accepted, are cancelled and will not be accessible.

      To help the person you’re removing from your organization transition and
      help ensure they delete confidential information or intellectual property,
      we recommend sharing a checklist of best practices for leaving your
      organization. For an example, see “<a
        href="/articles/best-practices-for-leaving-your-company/"
        >Best practices for leaving your company</a
      >.”
