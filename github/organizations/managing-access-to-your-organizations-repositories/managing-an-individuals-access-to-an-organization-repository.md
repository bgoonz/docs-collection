People with admin permissions can manage the access of organization members and outside collaborators to an organization repository.

## Removing access to repositories

When you remove a collaborator from a repository in your organization, the collaborator loses read and write access to the repository. If the repository is private and the collaborator has forked the repository, then their fork is also deleted, but the collaborator will still retain any local clones of your repository.

## Managing an individual's access to an organization repository

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.people %}
4. Click either **Members** or **Outside collaborators** to manage people with different types of access. ![Button to invite members or outside collaborators to an organization](/assets/images/help/organizations/select-outside-collaborators.png)
