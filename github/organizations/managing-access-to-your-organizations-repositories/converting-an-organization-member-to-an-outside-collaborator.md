After converting an organization member to an outside collaborator, they'll only have access to the repositories that their current team membership allows. The person will no longer be an explicit member of the organization, and will no longer be able to:

- Create teams
- See all organization members and teams
- @mention any visible team
- Be a team maintainer

For more information, see "[Permission levels for an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/permission-levels-for-an-organization)."

We recommend reviewing the organization member's access to repositories to ensure their access is as you expect. For more information, see "[Managing an individual's access to an organization repository](/articles/managing-an-individual-s-access-to-an-organization-repository)."

When you convert an organization member to an outside collaborator, their privileges as organization members are saved for three months so that you can restore their membership privileges if you{% ifversion fpt %} invite them to rejoin{% else %} add them back to{% endif %} your organization within that time frame. For more information, see "[Reinstating a former member of your organization](/articles/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization)."
