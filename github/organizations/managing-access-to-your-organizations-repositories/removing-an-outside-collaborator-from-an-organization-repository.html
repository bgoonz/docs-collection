      <strong>Warning:</strong> - When removing an outside collaborator from a
      private repository, the paid license count does not automatically
      downgrade. To pay for fewer licenses after removing users from your
      organization, follow the steps in “<a
        href="/articles/downgrading-your-organization-s-paid-seats"
        >Downgrading your organization’s paid seats</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a
        repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <p>{% endif %}</p>
    <p>
      While forks of private repositories are deleted when a collaborator is
      removed, the person will still retain any local clones of your repository.
