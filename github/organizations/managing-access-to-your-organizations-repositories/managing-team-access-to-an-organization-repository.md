People with admin access to a repository can manage team access to the repository. Team maintainers can remove a team's access to a repository.

{% warning %}

**Warnings:**
- You can change a team's permission level if the team has direct access to a repository. If the team's access to the repository is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team's access to the repository.
- If you add or remove repository access for a parent team, each of that parent's child teams will also receive or lose access to the repository. For more information, see "[About teams](/articles/about-teams)."

{% endwarning %}

## Removing a team's access to a repository

You can remove a team's access to a repository if the team has direct access to a repository. If a team's access to the repository is inherited from a parent team, you must remove the repository from the parent team in order to remove the repository from child teams.

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.specific_team %}
{% data reusables.organizations.team-repositories-tab %}
5. Select the repository or repositories you'd like to remove from the team.
