When an outside collaborator's access to your organization's private repositories is removed, the user's access privileges and settings are saved for three months. You can restore the user's privileges if you {% ifversion fpt %}invite{% else %}add{% endif %} them back to the organization within that time frame.

{% data reusables.two_fa.send-invite-to-reinstate-user-before-2fa-is-enabled %}

When you reinstate a former outside collaborator, you can restore:
 - The user's former access to organization repositories
 - Any private forks of repositories owned by the organization
 - Membership in the organization's teams
 - Previous access and permissions for the organization's repositories
 - Stars for organization repositories
 - Issue assignments in the organization
 - Repository subscriptions (notification settings for watching, not watching, or ignoring a repository's activity)

{% tip %}

**Tips**:
 - Only organization owners can reinstate outside collaborators' access to an organization. For more information, see "[Permission levels for an organization](/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization)."
 - The reinstating a member flow on {% data variables.product.product_location %} may use the term "member" to describe reinstating an outside collaborator but if you reinstate this person and keep their previous privileges, they will only have their previous [outside collaborator permissions](/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/#outside-collaborators).{% ifversion fpt %}
 - If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can invite a new member to join the organization or reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see "[About per-user pricing](/articles/about-per-user-pricing)."{% endif %}

6. Choose to restore the outside collaborator's previous privileges in the organization by clicking **Invite and reinstate** or choose to clear their previous privileges and set new access permissions by clicking **Invite and start fresh**.

  {% warning %}

  **Warning:** If you want to upgrade the outside collaborator to a member of your organization, then choose **Invite and start fresh** and choose a new role for this person. Note, however, that this person's private forks of your organization's repositories will be lost if you choose to start fresh. To make the former outside collaborator a member of your organization *and* keep their private forks, choose **Invite and reinstate** instead. Once this person accepts the invitation, you can convert them to an organization member by [inviting them to join the organization as a member](/articles/converting-an-outside-collaborator-to-an-organization-member).
