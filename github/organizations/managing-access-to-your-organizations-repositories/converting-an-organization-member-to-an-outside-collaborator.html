      After converting an organization member to an outside collaborator,
      they’ll only have access to the repositories that their current team
      membership allows. The person will no longer be an explicit member of the
      organization, and will no longer be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create teams</li>
      <li>See all organization members and teams</li>
      <li>
        <span class="citation" data-cites="mention">@mention</span> any visible
        team
      </li>
      <li>Be a team maintainer</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend reviewing the organization member’s access to repositories to
      ensure their access is as you expect. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/managing-an-individual-s-access-to-an-organization-repository"

      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When you convert an organization member to an outside collaborator, their
      privileges as organization members are saved for three months so that you
      can restore their membership privileges if you{% ifversion fpt %} invite
      them to rejoin{% else %} add them back to{% endif %} your organization
      within that time frame. For more information, see “<a

        >Reinstating a former member of your organization</a
      >.”
