shortTitle: Enable & test SAML SSO
---

You can enable SAML SSO in your organization without requiring all members to use it. Enabling but not enforcing SAML SSO in your organization can help smooth your organization's SAML SSO adoption. Once a majority of your organization's members use SAML SSO, you can enforce it within your organization.

If you enable but don't enforce SAML SSO, organization members who choose not to use SAML SSO can still be members of the organization. For more information on enforcing SAML SSO, see "[Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization](/articles/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization)."

Prior to enforcing SAML SSO in your organization, ensure that you've prepared the organization. For more information, see "[Preparing to enforce SAML single sign-on in your organization](/articles/preparing-to-enforce-saml-single-sign-on-in-your-organization)."

For more information about the identity providers (IdPs) that {% data variables.product.company_short %} supports for SAML SSO, see "[Connecting your identity provider to your organization](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/connecting-your-identity-provider-to-your-organization)."

5. Under "SAML single sign-on", select **Enable SAML authentication**.

  {% note %}

  **Note:** After enabling SAML SSO, you can download your single sign-on recovery codes so that you can access your organization even if your IdP is unavailable. For more information, see "[Downloading your organization's SAML single sign-on recovery codes](/articles/downloading-your-organization-s-saml-single-sign-on-recovery-codes)."

  {% endnote %}

6. In the "Sign on URL" field, type the HTTPS endpoint of your IdP for single sign-on requests. This value is available in your IdP configuration.

7. Optionally, in the "Issuer" field, type your SAML issuer's name. This verifies the authenticity of sent messages.
