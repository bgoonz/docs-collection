Organization administrators can use [one of their downloaded or saved recovery codes](/articles/downloading-your-organization-s-saml-single-sign-on-recovery-codes) to bypass single sign-on. You may have saved these to a password manager, such as [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), or [Keeper](https://keepersecurity.com/).

{% note %}

**Note:** You can only use recovery codes once and you must use them in consecutive order. Recovery codes grant access for 24 hours.

1. At the bottom of the single sign-on dialog, click **Use a recovery code** to bypass single sign-on.

After you've used a recovery code, make sure to note that it's no longer valid. You will not be able to reuse the recovery code.
