Recovery codes should not be shared or distributed. We recommend saving them with a password manager such as [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), or [Keeper](https://keepersecurity.com/).

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.security %}
5. Under "SAML single sign-on", in the note about recovery codes, click **Save your recovery codes**.

  {% note %}

  **Note:** Your recovery codes will help get you back into {% data variables.product.product_name %} if your IdP is unavailable. If you generate new recovery codes the recovery codes displayed on the "Single sign-on recovery codes" page are automatically updated.

  {% endnote %}

7. Once you use a recovery code to regain access to {% data variables.product.product_name %}, it cannot be reused. Access to {% data variables.product.product_name %} will only be available for 24 hours before you'll be asked to sign in using single sign-on.
