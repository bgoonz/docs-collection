## About enforcement of SAML SSO for your organization

When you enable SAML SSO, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will prompt members who visit the organization's resources on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to authenticate on your IdP, which links the member's user account to an identity on the IdP. Members can still access the organization's resources before authentication with your IdP.

You can also enforce SAML SSO for your organization. {% data reusables.saml.when-you-enforce %} Enforcement removes any members and administrators who have not authenticated via your IdP from the organization. {% data variables.product.company_short %} sends an email notification to each removed user. You can restore organization members once they successfully complete single sign-on.

Bots and service accounts that do not have external identities set up in your organization's IdP will also be removed when you enforce SAML SSO. For more information about bots and service accounts, see "[Managing bots and service accounts with SAML single sign-on](/articles/managing-bots-and-service-accounts-with-saml-single-sign-on)."

If your organization is owned by an enterprise account, requiring SAML for the enterprise account will override your organization-level SAML configuration and enforce SAML SSO for every organization in the enterprise. For more information, see "[Enforcing SAML single sign-on for organizations in your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/configuring-identity-and-access-management-for-your-enterprise-account/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account)."

## Enforcing SAML SSO for your organization

1. Enable and test SAML SSO for your organization, then authenticate with your IdP at least once. For more information, see "[Enabling and testing SAML single sign-on for your organization](/articles/enabling-and-testing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization)."
1. Prepare to enforce SAML SSO for your organization. For more information, see "[Preparing to enforce SAML single sign-on in your organization](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/preparing-to-enforce-saml-single-sign-on-in-your-organization)."

1. If any organization members have not authenticated via your IdP, {% data variables.product.company_short %} displays the members. If you enforce SAML SSO, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will remove the members from the organization. Review the warning and click **Remove members and require SAML single sign-on**.
