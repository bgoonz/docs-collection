<p>The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the <a href="/rest/reference/issues#comments">Issue Comments API</a>.</p>
<p>Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, “shared” actions for both features, like manipulating assignees, labels and milestones, are provided within <a href="/rest/reference/issues">the Issues API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>
<p>Pull Request Reviews are groups of Pull Request Review Comments on the Pull Request, grouped together with a state and optional body comment.</p>

<h2 id="review-comments">Review comments</h2>
<p>Pull request review comments are comments on a portion of the unified diff made during a pull request review. Commit comments and issue comments are different from pull request review comments. You apply commit comments directly to a commit and you apply issue comments without referencing a portion of the unified diff. For more information, see “<a href="/rest/reference/git#create-a-commit">Create a commit comment</a>” and “<a href="/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment">Create an issue comment</a>.”</p>
