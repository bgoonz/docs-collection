The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the [Issue Comments API](/rest/reference/issues#comments).

Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like manipulating assignees, labels and milestones, are provided within [the Issues API](/rest/reference/issues).

### Custom media types for pull requests

These are the supported media types for pull requests.

    application/vnd.github.VERSION.raw+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.text+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.html+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.full+json
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.diff
    application/vnd.github.VERSION.patch

For more information, see "[Custom media types](/rest/overview/media-types)."

<a id="diff-error">

If a diff is corrupt, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}. Include the repository name and pull request ID in your message.

### Link Relations

`review_comments`| The API location of this Pull Request's [Review comments](/rest/reference/pulls#comments).
`review_comment`| The [URL template](/rest#hypermedia) to construct the API location for a [Review comment](/rest/reference/pulls#comments) in this Pull Request's repository.
`commits`|The API location of this Pull Request's [commits](#list-commits-on-a-pull-request).
`statuses`| The API location of this Pull Request's [commit statuses](/rest/reference/repos#statuses), which are the statuses of its `head` branch.

## Reviews

Pull Request Reviews are groups of Pull Request Review Comments on the Pull
Request, grouped together with a state and optional body comment.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'reviews' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Review comments

Pull request review comments are comments on a portion of the unified diff made during a pull request review. Commit comments and issue comments are different from pull request review comments. You apply commit comments directly to a commit and you apply issue comments without referencing a portion of the unified diff. For more information, see "[Create a commit comment](/rest/reference/git#create-a-commit)" and "[Create an issue comment](/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment)."
