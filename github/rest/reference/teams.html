      The team discussions API allows you to get, create, edit, and delete
      discussion posts on a team’s page. You can use team discussions to have
      conversations that are not specific to a repository or project. Any member
      of the team’s <a href="/rest/reference/orgs">organization</a> can create
      and read public discussion posts. For more details, see “<a
        href="//organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions/"
        >About team discussions</a
      >.” To learn more about commenting on a discussion post, see the
      <a href="/rest/reference/teams#discussion-comments"
        >team discussion comments API</a
      >. This API is only available to authenticated members of the team’s
      organization.

      The team discussion comments API allows you to get, create, edit, and
      delete discussion comments on a
      <a href="/rest/reference/teams#discussions">team discussion</a> post. Any
      member of the team’s <a href="/rest/reference/orgs">organization</a> can
      create and read comments on a public discussion. For more details, see “<a
        href="/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions/"

      This API is only available to authenticated members of the team’s
      organization. OAuth access tokens require the <code>read:org</code>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When you have team synchronization set up for a
      team with your organization’s identity provider (IdP), you will see an
      error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team’s
      membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you
      can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which
      automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization"

    <p>
      The Team Synchronization API allows you to manage connections between {%
      data variables.product.product_name %} teams and external identity
      provider (IdP) groups. To use this API, the authenticated user must be a
      team maintainer or an owner of the organization associated with the team.
      The token you use to authenticate will also need to be authorized for use
      with your IdP (SSO) provider. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on"
        class="dotcom-only"

        organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manage GitHub team members through your IdP with team
      synchronization. Team synchronization must be enabled to use the Team
      Synchronization API. For more information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization"
