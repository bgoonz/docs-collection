You can use these endpoints to administer your enterprise.

{% ifversion fpt %}

{% note %}

**Note:** This article applies to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. To see the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} version, use the **{% data ui.pages.article_version %}** drop-down menu.

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

### Endpoint URLs

REST API endpoints{% ifversion ghes %}—except [Management Console](#management-console) API endpoints—{% endif %} are prefixed with the following URL:

```shell
{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}
```

{% ifversion ghes %}
[Management Console](#management-console) API endpoints are only prefixed with a hostname:

```shell
http(s)://<em>hostname</em>/
```
{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}
### Authentication

Your {% data variables.product.product_name %} installation's API endpoints accept [the same authentication methods](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) as the GitHub.com API. You can authenticate yourself with **[OAuth tokens](/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/)** {% ifversion ghes %}(which can be created using the [Authorizations API](/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations#create-a-new-authorization)) {% endif %}or **[basic authentication](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#basic-authentication)**. {% ifversion ghes %}
OAuth tokens must have the `site_admin` [OAuth scope](/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) when used with Enterprise-specific endpoints.{% endif %}

Enterprise administration API endpoints are only accessible to authenticated {% data variables.product.product_name %} site administrators{% ifversion ghes %}, except for the [Management Console](#management-console) API, which requires the [Management Console password](/enterprise/admin/articles/accessing-the-management-console/){% endif %}.

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}
### Version information

The current version of your enterprise is returned in the response header of every API:
`X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version: {{currentVersion}}.0`
You can also read the current version by calling the [meta endpoint](/rest/reference/meta/).

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% unless operation.subcategory %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endunless %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}

## Audit log

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'audit-log' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
## Billing

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'billing' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 2.21 or ghae %}
## GitHub Actions

{% data reusables.actions.ae-beta %}

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'actions' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}
## Admin stats

The Admin Stats API provides a variety of metrics about your installation. *It is only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) site administrators.* Normal users will receive a `404` response if they try to access it.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'admin-stats' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae or ghes > 2.22 %}

## Announcements

The Announcements API allows you to manage the global announcement banner in your enterprise. For more information, see "[Customizing user messages for your enterprise](/admin/user-management/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise#creating-a-global-announcement-banner)."

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'announcement' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}

## Global webhooks

Global webhooks are installed on your enterprise. You can use global webhooks to automatically monitor, respond to, or enforce rules for users, organizations, teams, and repositories on your enterprise. Global webhooks can subscribe to the [organization](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#organization), [user](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#user), [repository](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#repository), [team](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#team), [member](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#member), [membership](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#membership), [fork](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#fork), and [ping](/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks#ping-event) event types.

*This API is only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) site administrators.* Normal users will receive a `404` response if they try to access it. To learn how to configure global webhooks, see [About global webhooks](/enterprise/admin/user-management/about-global-webhooks).

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'global-webhooks' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes %}

## LDAP

You can use the LDAP API to update account relationships between a {% data variables.product.product_name %} user or team and its linked LDAP entry or queue a new synchronization.

With the LDAP mapping endpoints, you're able to update the Distinguished Name (DN) that a user or team maps to. Note that the LDAP endpoints are generally only effective if your {% data variables.product.product_name %} appliance has [LDAP Sync enabled](/enterprise/admin/authentication/using-ldap). The [Update LDAP mapping for a user](#update-ldap-mapping-for-a-user) endpoint can be used when LDAP is enabled, even if LDAP Sync is disabled.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'ldap' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}


{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}
## License

The License API provides information on your Enterprise license. *It is only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) site administrators.* Normal users will receive a `404` response if they try to access it.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'license' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes %}

## Management console

The Management Console API helps you manage your {% data variables.product.product_name %} installation.

{% tip %}

You must explicitly set the port number when making API calls to the Management Console. If TLS is enabled on your enterprise, the port number is `8443`; otherwise, the port number is `8080`.

If you don't want to provide a port number, you'll need to configure your tool to automatically follow redirects.

You may also need to add the [`-k` flag](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-k) when using `curl`, since {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses a self-signed certificate before you [add your own TLS certificate](/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/configuring-tls/).

{% endtip %}

### Authentication

You need to pass your [Management Console password](/enterprise/admin/articles/accessing-the-management-console/) as an authentication token to every Management Console API endpoint except [`/setup/api/start`](#create-a-github-enterprise-server-license).

Use the `api_key` parameter to send this token with each request. For example:

```shell
$ curl -L 'https://<em>hostname</em>:<em>admin_port</em>/setup/api?api_key=<em>your-amazing-password</em>'
```

You can also use standard HTTP authentication to send this token. For example:

```shell
$ curl -L 'https://api_key:<em>your-amazing-password</em>@<em>hostname</em>:<em>admin_port</em>/setup/api'
```

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'management-console' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae or ghes %}
## Organizations

The Organization Administration API allows you to create organizations on your enterprise. *It is only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) site administrators.* Normal users will receive a `404` response if they try to access it.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'orgs' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}
