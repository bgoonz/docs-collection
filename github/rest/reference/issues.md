The Issue Events API can return different types of events triggered by activity in issues and pull requests. For more information about the specific events that you can receive from the Issue Events API, see "[Issue event types](/developers/webhooks-and-events/issue-event-types)." An events API for GitHub activity outside of issues and pull requests is also available. For more information, see the "[Events API](/developers/webhooks-and-events/github-event-types)."

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'events' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}

The Timeline Events API can return different types of events triggered by timeline activity in issues and pull requests. For more information about the specific events that you can receive from the Issue Events API, see "[Issue event types](/developers/webhooks-and-events/issue-event-types)."
