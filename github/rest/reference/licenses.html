      The Licenses API returns metadata about popular open source licenses and
      information about a particular project’s license file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Licenses API uses
      <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/licensee"
        >the open source Ruby Gem Licensee</a
      >
      to attempt to identify the project’s license. Licensee matches the
      contents of a project’s <code>LICENSE</code> file (if it exists) against a
      short list of known licenses. As a result, the API does not take into
      account the licenses of project dependencies or other means of documenting
      a project’s license such as references to the license name in the
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a license is matched, the license key and name returned conforms to the
      <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX specification</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> These endpoints will also return a repository’s
      license information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/rest/reference/repos#get-a-repository">Get a repository</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user"
          >List repositories for a user</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/rest/reference/repos#list-organization-repositories"
          >List organization repositories</a
        >
      </li>
      <li><a href="/rest/reference/repos#list-forks">List forks</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="/rest/reference/activity#list-repositories-watched-by-a-user"
          >List repositories watched by a user</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/rest/reference/teams#list-team-repositories"
          >List team repositories</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

      GitHub is a lot of things, but it’s not a law firm. As such, GitHub does
      not provide legal advice. Using the Licenses API or sending us an email
      about it does not constitute legal advice nor does it create an
      attorney-client relationship. If you have any questions about what you can
      and can’t do with a particular license, you should consult with your own
      legal counsel before moving forward. In fact, you should always consult
      with your own lawyer before making any decisions that might have legal
      ramifications or that may impact your legal rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub created the License API to help users get information about open
      source licenses and the projects that use them. We hope it helps, but
      please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers (at least most of us aren’t)
      and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, GitHub
      provides the API on an “as-is” basis and makes no warranties regarding any
      information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability
      for damages resulting from using the API.
