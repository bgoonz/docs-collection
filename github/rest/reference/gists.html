      You can read public gists {% ifversion ghae or ghes %}and create them for
      anonymous users without a token.{% else %} anonymously, but you must be
      signed into GitHub to create gists.{% endif %} To read or write gists on a
      user’s behalf, you need the gist OAuth scope and a token. For more
      information, see “<a href="/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps"
        >Scopes for OAuth Apps</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <!-- When an OAuth client does not have the gists scope, the API will return a 404 "Not Found" response regardless of the validity of the credentials. The API will return a 401 "Bad credentials" response if the gists scope was given to the application but the credentials are invalid. -->
    <h3 id="truncation">Truncation</h3>
    <p>
      The Gist API provides up to one megabyte of content for each file in the
      gist. Each file returned for a gist through the API has a key called
      <code>truncated</code>. If <code>truncated</code> is <code>true</code>,
      the file is too large and only a portion of the contents were returned in
      <code>content</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need the full contents of the file, you can make a
      <code>GET</code> request to the URL specified by <code>raw_url</code>. Be
      aware that for files larger than ten megabytes, you’ll need to clone the
      gist via the URL provided by <code>git_pull_url</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to a specific file’s contents being truncated, the entire
      files list may be truncated if the total number exceeds 300 files. If the
      top level <code>truncated</code> key is <code>true</code>, only the first
      300 files have been returned in the files list. If you need to fetch all
      of the gist’s files, you’ll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by
      <code>git_pull_url</code>.
