      The token used to authenticate the call must have the
      <code>admin:org</code> scope in order to make any blocking calls for an
      organization. Otherwise, the response returns <code>HTTP 404</code>.

      Organization webhooks allow you to receive HTTP <code>POST</code> payloads
      whenever certain events happen in an organization. {% data
      reusables.webhooks.webhooks-rest-api-links %}
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on actions you can subscribe to, see “<a
        href="/developers/webhooks-and-events/github-event-types"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} event types</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="scopes-restrictions">Scopes &amp; Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      All actions against organization webhooks require the authenticated user
      to be an admin of the organization being managed. Additionally, OAuth
      tokens require the <code>admin:org_hook</code> scope. For more
      information, see “<a href="/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps"
        >Scopes for OAuth Apps</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to protect sensitive data which may be present in webhook
      configurations, we also enforce the following access control rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        OAuth applications cannot list, view, or edit webhooks which they did
        not create.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks which were created by OAuth
        applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="receiving-webhooks">Receiving Webhooks</h3>
    <p>
      In order for {% data variables.product.product_name %} to send webhook
      payloads, your server needs to be accessible from the Internet. We also
      highly suggest using SSL so that we can send encrypted payloads over
      HTTPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more best practices,
      <a href="/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/">see our guide</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="webhook-headers">Webhook headers</h4>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} will send along several HTTP
      headers to differentiate between event types and payload identifiers. See
      <a href="/webhooks/event-payloads/#delivery-headers">webhook headers</a>
      for details.
