Let's walk through core API concepts as we tackle some everyday use cases.

{% data reusables.rest-api.dotcom-only-guide-note %}

## Overview

Most applications will use an existing [wrapper library][wrappers] in the language
of your choice, but it's important to familiarize yourself with the underlying API
HTTP methods first.

There's no easier way to kick the tires than through [cURL][curl].{% ifversion fpt %} If you are using
an alternative client, note that you are required to send a valid
[User Agent header](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#user-agent-required) in your request.{% endif %}

### Hello World

Let's start by testing our setup. Open up a command prompt and enter the
following command:

```shell
$ curl https://api.github.com/zen

> Keep it logically awesome.
```

The response will be a random selection from our design philosophies.

Next, let's `GET` [Chris Wanstrath's][defunkt github] [GitHub profile][users api]:

```shell
# GET /users/defunkt
$ curl https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> {
>   "login": "defunkt",
>   "id": 2,
>   "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI=",
>   "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2?v=4",
>   "gravatar_id": "",
>   "url": "https://api.github.com/users/defunkt",
>   "html_url": "https://github.com/defunkt",
>   ...
> }
```

Mmmmm, tastes like [JSON][json]. Let's add the `-i` flag to include headers:

```shell
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> HTTP/2 200 
> server: GitHub.com
> date: Thu, 08 Jul 2021 07:04:08 GMT

```

There are a few interesting bits in the response headers. As expected, the
`Content-Type` is `application/json`.

Any headers beginning with `X-` are custom headers, and are not included in the
HTTP spec. For example:

* `X-GitHub-Media-Type` has a value of `github.v3`. This lets us know the [media type][media types]
for the response. Media types have helped us version our output in API v3. We'll
talk more about that later.
* Take note of the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers. This
pair of headers indicate [how many requests a client can make][rate-limiting] in
a rolling time period (typically an hour) and how many of those requests the
client has already spent.

## Authentication

Unauthenticated clients can make 60 requests per hour. To get more requests per hour, we'll need to
_authenticate_. In fact, doing anything interesting with the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API requires
[authentication][authentication].

### Using personal access tokens

The easiest and best way to authenticate with the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API is by using Basic Authentication [via OAuth tokens](/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#via-oauth-and-personal-access-tokens). OAuth tokens include [personal access tokens][personal token].

Use a `-u` flag to set your username:

```shell
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat

```

When prompted, you can enter your OAuth token, but we recommend you set up a variable for it:

You can use `-u "username:$token"` and set up a variable for `token` to avoid leaving your token in shell history, which should be avoided.

```shell
$ curl -i -u <em>username:$token</em> {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat

```

When authenticating, you should see your rate limit bumped to 5,000 requests an hour, as indicated in the `X-RateLimit-Limit` header. In addition to providing more calls per hour, authentication enables you to read and write private information using the API.

You can easily [create a **personal access token**][personal token] using your [Personal access tokens settings page][tokens settings]:

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-issue-4374 %}
{% warning %}

To help keep your information secure, we highly recommend setting an expiration for your personal access tokens.

{% endwarning %}
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes %}
![Personal Token selection](/assets/images/personal_token.png)
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae %}
![Personal Token selection](/assets/images/help/personal_token_ghae.png)
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-issue-4374 %}
API requests using an expiring personal access token will return that token's expiration date via the `GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` header. You can use the header in your scripts to provide a warning message when the token is close to its expiration date.
{% endif %}

### Get your own user profile

When properly authenticated, you can take advantage of the permissions
associated with your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account. For example, try getting
[your own user profile][auth user api]:

```shell
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em>:<em>your_token</em> {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user

> {
>   ...
>   "plan": {
>     "space": 2516582,
>    "collaborators": 10,
>    "private_repos": 20,
>    "name": "medium"
>  }
>   ...
> }
```

This time, in addition to the same set of public information we
retrieved for [@defunkt][defunkt github] earlier, you should also see the non-public information for your user profile. For example, you'll see a `plan` object in the response which gives details about the {% data variables.product.product_name %} plan for the account.

### Using OAuth tokens for apps

Apps that need to read or write private information using the API on behalf of another user should use [OAuth][oauth].

OAuth uses _tokens_. Tokens provide two big features:

* **Revokable access**: users can revoke authorization to third party apps at any time
* **Limited access**: users can review the specific access that a token
  will provide before authorizing a third party app

Tokens should be created via a [web flow][webflow]. An application
sends users to {% data variables.product.product_name %} to log in. {% data variables.product.product_name %} then presents a dialog
indicating the name of the app, as well as the level of access the app
has once it's authorized by the user. After a user authorizes access, {% data variables.product.product_name %}
redirects the user back to the application:

![GitHub's OAuth Prompt](/assets/images/oauth_prompt.png)

**Treat OAuth tokens like passwords!** Don't share them with other users or store
them in insecure places. The tokens in these examples are fake and the names have
been changed to protect the innocent.

Now that we've got the hang of making authenticated calls, let's move along to
the [Repositories API][repos-api].

## Repositories

Almost any meaningful use of the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API will involve some level of Repository
information. We can [`GET` repository details][get repo] in the same way we fetched user
details earlier:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/twbs/bootstrap
```

In the same way, we can [view repositories for the authenticated user][user repos api]:

```shell
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}ghp_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a{% else %}5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4{% endif %}" \
    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user/repos
```

Or, we can [list repositories for another user][other user repos api]:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat/repos
```

Or, we can [list repositories for an organization][org repos api]:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/orgs/octo-org/repos
```

The information returned from these calls will depend on which scopes our token has when we authenticate:

{% ifversion not ghae %}
* A token with `public_repo` [scope][scopes] returns a response that includes all public repositories we have access to see on github.com.{% endif %}
* A token with `repo` [scope][scopes] returns a response that includes all {% ifversion not ghae %}public{% else %}internal{% endif %} and private repositories we have access to see on {% data variables.product.product_location %}.

As the [docs][repos-api] indicate, these methods take a `type` parameter that
can filter the repositories returned based on what type of access the user has
for the repository. In this way, we can fetch only directly-owned repositories,
organization repositories, or repositories the user collaborates on via a team.

```shell
$ curl -i "{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat/repos?type=owner"
```

In this example, we grab only those repositories that octocat owns, not the
ones on which she collaborates. Note the quoted URL above. Depending on your
shell setup, cURL sometimes requires a quoted URL or else it ignores the
query string.

### Create a repository

Fetching information for existing repositories is a common use case, but the
{% data variables.product.product_name %} API supports creating new repositories as well. To [create a repository][create repo],
we need to `POST` some JSON containing the details and configuration options.

```shell
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}ghp_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a{% else %}5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4{% endif %}" \
    -d '{ \
        "name": "blog", \
        "auto_init": true, \
        "private": true, \
        "gitignore_template": "nanoc" \
      }' \
    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user/repos
```

In this minimal example, we create a new private repository for our blog (to be served
on [GitHub Pages][pages], perhaps). Though the blog {% ifversion not ghae %}will be public{% else %}is accessible to all enterprise members{% endif %}, we've made the repository private. In this single step, we'll also initialize it with a README and a [nanoc][nanoc]-flavored [.gitignore template][gitignore templates].

The resulting repository will be found at `https://github.com/<your_username>/blog`.
To create a repository under an organization for which you're
an owner, just change the API method from `/user/repos` to `/orgs/<org_name>/repos`.

Next, let's fetch our newly created repository:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/pengwynn/blog

> HTTP/2 404

> {
>    "message": "Not Found"
> }
```

Oh noes! Where did it go? Since we created the repository as _private_, we need
to authenticate in order to see it. If you're a grizzled HTTP user, you might
expect a `403` instead. Since we don't want to leak information about private
repositories, the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API returns a `404` in this case, as if to say "we can
neither confirm nor deny the existence of this repository."

## Issues

The UI for Issues on {% data variables.product.product_name %} aims to provide 'just enough' workflow while
staying out of your way. With the {% data variables.product.product_name %} [Issues API][issues-api], you can pull
data out or create issues from other tools to create a workflow that works for
your team.

Just like github.com, the API provides a few methods to view issues for the
authenticated user. To [see all your issues][get issues api], call `GET /issues`:

```shell
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}ghp_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a{% else %}5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4{% endif %}" \
    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/issues
```

To get only the [issues under one of your {% data variables.product.product_name %} organizations][get issues api], call `GET
/orgs/<org>/issues`:

```shell
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}ghp_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a{% else %}5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4{% endif %}" \
    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/orgs/rails/issues
```

We can also get [all the issues under a single repository][repo issues api]:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/rails/rails/issues
```

### Pagination

A project the size of Rails has thousands of issues. We'll need to [paginate][pagination],
making multiple API calls to get the data. Let's repeat that last call, this
time taking note of the response headers:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/rails/rails/issues

> HTTP/2 200

> ...
> Link: &lt;{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repositories/8514/issues?page=2&gt;; rel="next", &lt;{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repositories/8514/issues?page=30&gt;; rel="last"
> ...
```

The [`Link` header][link-header] provides a way for a response to link to
external resources, in this case additional pages of data. Since our call found
more than thirty issues (the default page size), the API tells us where we can
find the next page and the last page of results.

### Creating an issue

Now that we've seen how to paginate lists of issues, let's [create an issue][create issue] from
the API.

To create an issue, we need to be authenticated, so we'll pass an
OAuth token in the header. Also, we'll pass the title, body, and labels in the JSON
body to the `/issues` path underneath the repository in which we want to create
the issue:

```shell
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}ghp_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a{% else %}5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4{% endif %}' \
$    -d '{ \
$         "title": "New logo", \
$         "body": "We should have one", \
$         "labels": ["design"] \
$       }' \
$    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues

> HTTP/2 201
> Location: {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17
> X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000

> {
>   "pull_request": {
>     "patch_url": null,
>     "html_url": null,
>     "diff_url": null
>   },
>   "created_at": "2012-11-14T15:25:33Z",

>   },
>   "closed_at": null,
>   "updated_at": "2012-11-14T15:25:33Z",
>   "number": 17,
>   "closed_by": null,
>   "html_url": "https://github.com/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17",
>   "labels": [
>     {
>       "color": "ededed",
>       "name": "design",
>       "url": "{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/labels/design"
>     }
>   ],
>   "id": 8356941,
>   "assignee": null,
>   "state": "open",
>   "url": "{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17"
> }
```

The response gives us a couple of pointers to the newly created issue, both in
the `Location` response header and the `url` field of the JSON response.

## Conditional requests

A big part of being a good API citizen is respecting rate limits by caching information that hasn't changed. The API supports [conditional
requests][conditional-requests] and helps you do the right thing. Consider the
first call we made to get defunkt's profile:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/defunkt

> HTTP/2 200
> etag: W/"61e964bf6efa3bc3f9e8549e56d4db6e0911d8fa20fcd8ab9d88f13d513f26f0"
```

In addition to the JSON body, take note of the HTTP status code of `200` and
the `ETag` header.
The [ETag][etag] is a fingerprint of the response. If we pass that on subsequent calls,
we can tell the API to give us the resource again, only if it has changed:

```shell
$ curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "61e964bf6efa3bc3f9e8549e56d4db6e0911d8fa20fcd8ab9d88f13d513f26f0"' \
$    {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/defunkt

> HTTP/2 304
```

The `304` status indicates that the resource hasn't changed since the last time
we asked for it and the response will contain no body. As a bonus, `304` responses don't count against your [rate limit][rate-limiting].

Woot! Now you know the basics of the {% data variables.product.product_name %} API!
