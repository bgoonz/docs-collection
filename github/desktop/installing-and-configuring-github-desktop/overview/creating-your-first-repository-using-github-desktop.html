      {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} extends and simplifies your
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} workflow, using a
      visual interface instead of text commands on the command line. By the end
      of this guide, you’ll have used {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop
      %} to create a repository, make changes to the repository, and publish the
      changes to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      After installing {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} and signing
      into {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or {% data
      variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} you can create and clone a
      tutorial repository. The tutorial will introduce the basics of working
      with Git and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, including
      installing a text editor, creating a branch, making a commit, pushing to
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, and opening a
      pull request. The tutorial is available if you do not have any
      repositories on {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend completing the tutorial, but if you want to explore {% data
      variables.product.prodname_desktop %} by creating a new repository, this
      guide will walk you through using {% data
      variables.product.prodname_desktop %} to work on a Git repository.

      Part 1: Installing {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} and
      authenticating your account
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can install {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} on any
      supported operating system. After you install the app, you will need to
      sign in and authenticate your account on {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or {% data
      variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} before you can create and clone a
      tutorial repository.
    </p>

      view, where you can choose to create and clone a tutorial repository,
      clone an existing repository from the Internet, create a new repository,
      or add an existing repository from your hard drive.

            “Local path” sets the location of your repository on your computer.

            store your repositories, but you can choose any location on your
            computer. Your new repository will be a folder inside the chosen
            location. For example, if you name your repository
            <code>Tutorial</code>, a folder named <em>Tutorial</em> is created
            inside the folder you selected for your local path. {% data
            variables.product.prodname_desktop %} remembers your chosen location
            the next time you create or clone a new repository.

            visits your repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %},
            the README is the first thing they’ll see as they learn about your

      view these by clicking on <strong>Current branch</strong>. -
      <strong>Publish repository</strong> appears because you haven’t published
      your repository to {% data variables.product.product_name %} yet, which
      you’ll do later in the next step. This section of the bar will change

      to {% data variables.product.product_name %}. You can follow this same
