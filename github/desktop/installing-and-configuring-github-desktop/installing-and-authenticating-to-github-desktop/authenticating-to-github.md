Review the troubleshooting information below for the error message that you encounter.

### Bad credentials

```shell
Error: Bad credentials
```

This error means that there is an issue with your stored account credentials.

To troubleshoot, sign out of your account on {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} and then sign back in.

### Empty token

```shell
info: [ui] [AppStore.withAuthenticatingUser] account found for repository: node - <username> (empty token)
```

This error means that {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} is unable to find the access token that it created in the system keychain.

To troubleshoot, sign out of your account on {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} and then sign back in.

### Repository not found

```shell
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git' not found

(The error was parsed as 8: The repository does not seem to exist anymore. You may not have access, or it may have been deleted or renamed.)
```

This error means that you do not have permission to access the repository that you are trying to clone.

To troubleshoot, contact the person in your organization who administers permissions.

### Could not read from remote repository

```shell
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

This error means that you do not have a valid SSH key set up.

To troubleshoot, see "[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the SSH agent](/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)."

### Failed to clone

```shell
fatal: clone of 'git@github.com:<user>/<repo>' into submodule path '<path>' failed
Failed to clone 'src/github.com/<user>/<repo>'. Retry scheduled
Cloning into '<path>'...
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

This error means that either the repository that you are trying to clone has submodules that you do not have access to or you do not have a valid SSH key set up.

If you do not have access to the submodules, troubleshoot by contacting the person who administers permissions for the repository.

If you do not have a valid SSH key set up, see "[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the SSH agent](/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)."

{% windows %}

### Unable to read AskPass response

```shell
error: unable to read askpass response from '/Users/<path>/GitHub Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app/static/ask-pass-trampoline.sh'
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled
```

This error can be caused by multiple events.

If the `Command Processor` registry entries are modified, {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} will respond with an `Authentication failed` error. To check if these registry entries have been modified, follow these steps.

1. Open the Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`) and navigate to the following locations.
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\`
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\`
2. Check to see if there is an `Autorun` value in either location.
3. If there is an `Autorun` value, delete it.

If your Windows username has extended Unicode characters, it may cause an AskPass response error. To troubleshoot, create a new Windows user account and migrate your files to that account. For more information, see "[Create a user account in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account)" in the Microsoft documentation.
