    <p>
      You can use branches to safely experiment with changes to your project.
      Branches isolate your development work from other branches in the
      repository. For example, you could use a branch to develop a new feature
      or fix a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might
      create a branch from the default branch of your repository. You can then
      work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are
      making to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also create a branch starting from a previous commit in a branch’s
      history. This can be helpful if you need to return to an earlier view of
      the repository to investigate a bug, or to create a hot fix on top of your
      latest release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’re satisfied with your work, you can create a pull request to
      merge your changes in the current branch into another branch. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request"
        >Creating an issue or pull request</a
      >” and “<a href="/articles/about-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always create a branch in {% data
      variables.product.prodname_desktop %} if you have read access to a
      repository, but you can only push the branch to {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} if you have write access to the
      repository.

      <strong>Tip:</strong> The first new branch you create will be based on the
      default branch. If you have more than one branch, you can choose to base
      the new branch on the currently checked out branch or the default branch.

    <h2 id="switching-between-branches">Switching between branches</h2>
    <p>
      You can view and make commits to any of your repository’s branches. If you
      have uncommitted, saved changes, you’ll need to decide what to do with
      your changes before you can switch branches. You can commit your changes
      on the current branch, stash your changes to temporarily save them on the
      current branch, or bring the changes to your new branch. If you want to
      commit your changes before switching branches, see “<a
        href="/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project"
        >Committing and reviewing changes to your project</a
      >.” {% tip %}
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip</strong>: You can set a default behavior for switching
      branches in the <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/configuring-basic-settings"
