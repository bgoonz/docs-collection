    <h3 id="creating-a-partial-commit">Creating a partial commit</h3>
    <p>
      If one file contains multiple changes, but you only want some of those
      changes to be included in a commit, you can create a partial commit. The
      rest of your changes will remain intact, so that you can make additional
      modifications and commits. This allows you to make separate, meaningful
      commits, such as keeping line break changes in a commit separate from code
      or prose changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To exclude changed lines from your commit, click one or more changed lines
      so the blue disappears. The lines that are still highlighted in blue will
      be included in the commit.

    <h2 id="discarding-changes">Discarding changes</h2>
    <p>
      If you have uncommitted changes that you don’t want to keep, you can
      discard the changes. This will remove the changes from the files on your
      computer. You can discard all uncommitted changes in one or more files, or
      you can discard specific lines you added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discarded changes are saved in a dated file in the Trash. You can recover
      discarded changes until the Trash is emptied.
