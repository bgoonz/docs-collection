## About squashing a commit

Squashing allows you to combine multiple commits in your branch's history into a single commit. This can help keep your repository's history more readable and understandable.

## Error messages when squashing commits

When you squash commits, you may see one of the following notifications or error messages.

* A notification states that the requested change to the branch will require a force push to update the remote branch. Force pushing alters the commit history of the branch and will affect other collaborators who are working in that branch.  Select **Begin Squash** to start the squash, and then click **Force push origin** to push your changes.

* An error states that the squash failed because there is a merge commit among the squashed commits.

* A notification is shown indicating that there are uncommitted changes present on your current branch. Select **Stash Changes and Continue** to store the changes and proceed, or select **Close** to dismiss the message and commit the changes. When there are no longer any uncommitted changes you can squash your commits.
