    <p>
      Squashing allows you to combine multiple commits in your branch’s history
      into a single commit. This can help keep your repository’s history more
      readable and understandable.

      Error messages when squashing commits
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you squash commits, you may see one of the following notifications or
      error messages.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A notification states that the requested change to the branch will
          require a force push to update the remote branch. Force pushing alters
          the commit history of the branch and will affect other collaborators
          who are working in that branch. Select
          <strong>Begin Squash</strong> to start the squash, and then click
          <strong>Force push origin</strong> to push your changes.
        </p>

          An error states that the squash failed because there is a merge commit
          among the squashed commits.

          A notification is shown indicating that there are uncommitted changes
          present on your current branch. Select
          <strong>Stash Changes and Continue</strong> to store the changes and
          proceed, or select <strong>Close</strong> to dismiss the message and
          commit the changes. When there are no longer any uncommitted changes
          you can squash your commits.
