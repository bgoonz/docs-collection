      About required reviews in workflows
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jobs that reference an environment configured with required reviewers will
      wait for an approval before starting. While a job is awaiting approval, it
      has a status of “Waiting”. If a job is not approved within 30 days, the
      workflow run will be automatically canceled.
    </p>
    <p>

        >Environments</a

            a job is approved (and any other environment protection rules have
            passed), the job will proceed. At this point, the job can access any
            secrets stored in the environment.

          <li>
            To reject the job, click <strong>Reject</strong>. If a job is
            rejected, the workflow will fail.
