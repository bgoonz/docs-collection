## About required reviews in workflows

Jobs that reference an environment configured with required reviewers will wait for an approval before starting. While a job is awaiting approval, it has a status of "Waiting". If a job is not approved within 30 days, the workflow run will be automatically canceled.

For more information about environments and required approvals, see "[Environments](/actions/reference/environments)."{% ifversion fpt or ghae-next or ghes > 3.1 %} For information about how to review deployments with the REST API, see "[Workflow Runs](/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs)."{% endif %}

## Approving or rejecting a job

1. Navigate to the workflow run that requires review. For more information about navigating to a workflow run, see "[Viewing workflow run history](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/viewing-workflow-run-history)."
2. Click **Review deployments**.

3. Select the job environment(s) to approve or reject. Optionally, leave a comment.

4. Approve or reject:
   - To approve the job, click **Approve and deploy**. Once a job is approved (and any other environment protection rules have passed), the job will proceed. At this point, the job can access any secrets stored in the environment.
   - To reject the job, click **Reject**. If a job is rejected, the workflow will fail.
