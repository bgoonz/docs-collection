Disabling a workflow allows you to stop a workflow from being triggered without having to delete the file from the repo. You can easily re-enable the workflow again on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

Temporarily disabling a workflow can be useful in many scenarios. These are a few examples where disabling a workflow might be helpful:

- A workflow error that produces too many or wrong requests, impacting external services negatively.
- A workflow that is not critical and is consuming too many minutes on your account.
- A workflow that sends requests to a service that is down.
- Workflows on a forked repository that aren't needed (for example, scheduled workflows).

You can also disable and enable a workflow using the REST API. For more information, see the "[Actions REST API](/rest/reference/actions#workflows)."

### Disabling a workflow

{% include tool-switcher %}

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}

1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to disable.
   ![actions select workflow](/assets/images/actions-select-workflow.png)
1. Click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}.
   ![actions kebab menu](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-workflow-menu-kebab.png)
1. Click **Disable workflow**.
   ![actions disable workflow](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-disable-workflow.png)
   The disabled workflow is marked {% octicon "stop" aria-label="The stop icon" %} to indicate its status.
   ![actions list disabled workflow](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-find-disabled-workflow.png)

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.download-cli %}

{% data reusables.actions.actions-cli %}

To disable a workflow, use the `workflow disable` subcommand. Replace `workflow` with either the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to disable. For example, `"Link Checker"`, `1234567`, or `"link-check-test.yml"`. If you don't specify a workflow, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a workflow.

```shell
gh workflow disable <em>workflow</em>
```

{% endcli %}

### Enabling a workflow

{% include tool-switcher %}

{% webui %}

You can re-enable a workflow that was previously disabled.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}

1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to enable.
   ![actions select disabled workflow](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-select-disabled-workflow.png)
1. Click **Enable workflow**.
   ![actions enable workflow](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-enable-workflow.png)

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.actions.actions-cli %}

To enable a workflow, use the `workflow enable` subcommand. Replace `workflow` with either the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to enable. For example, `"Link Checker"`, `1234567`, or `"link-check-test.yml"`. If you don't specify a workflow, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a workflow.

```shell
gh workflow enable <em>workflow</em>
```

{% endcli %}
