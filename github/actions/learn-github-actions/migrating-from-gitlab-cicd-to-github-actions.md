## Introduction

GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} both allow you to create workflows that automatically build, test, publish, release, and deploy code. GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} share some similarities in workflow configuration:

- Workflow configuration files are written in YAML and are stored in the code's repository.
- Workflows include one or more jobs.
- Jobs include one or more steps or individual commands.
- Jobs can run on either managed or self-hosted machines.

There are a few differences, and this guide will show you the important differences so that you can migrate your workflow to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

## Jobs

Jobs in GitLab CI/CD are very similar to jobs in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. In both systems, jobs have the following characteristics:

- Jobs contain a series of steps or scripts that run sequentially.
- Jobs can run on separate machines or in separate containers.
- Jobs run in parallel by default, but can be configured to run sequentially.

You can run a script or a shell command in a job. In GitLab CI/CD, script steps are specified using the `script` key. In {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, all scripts are specified using the `run` key.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
job1:
  variables:
    GIT_CHECKOUT: "true"
  script:
    - echo "Run your script here"
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "Run your script here"
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Runners

Runners are machines on which the jobs run. Both GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} offer managed and self-hosted variants of runners. In GitLab CI/CD, `tags` are used to run jobs on different platforms, while in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} it is done with the `runs-on` key.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table>
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
windows_job:
  tags:
    - windows
  script:
    - echo Hello, %USERNAME%!

linux_job:
tags: - linux
script: - echo "Hello, $USER!"

````
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
windows_job:
  runs-on: windows-latest
  steps:
    - run: echo Hello, %USERNAME%!

linux_job:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello, $USER!"
````

{% endraw %}

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Docker images

Both GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} support running jobs in a Docker image. In GitLab CI/CD, Docker images are defined with a `image` key, while in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} it is done with the `container` key.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
my_job:
  image: node:10.16-jessie
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    container: node:10.16-jessie
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer)."

## Condition and expression syntax

GitLab CI/CD uses `rules` to determine if a job will run for a specific condition. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses the `if` keyword to prevent a job from running unless a condition is met.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
deploy_prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production server"
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "master"'
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy_prod:
    if: contains( github.ref, 'master')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploy to production server"
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Dependencies between Jobs

Both GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} allow you to set dependencies for a job. In both systems, jobs run in parallel by default, but job dependencies in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can be specified explicitly with the `needs` key. GitLab CI/CD also has a concept of `stages`, where jobs in a stage run concurrently, but the next stage will start when all the jobs in the previous stage have completed. You can recreate this scenario in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} with the `needs` key.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system. The workflows start with two jobs named `build_a` and `build_b` running in parallel, and when those jobs complete, another job called `test_ab` will run. Finally, when `test_ab` completes, the `deploy_ab` job will run.

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_a:
stage: build
script: - echo "This job will run first."

build_b:
stage: build
script: - echo "This job will run first, in parallel with build_a."

test_ab:
stage: test
script: - echo "This job will run after build_a and build_b have finished."

deploy_ab:
stage: deploy
script: - echo "This job will run after test_ab is complete"

````
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  build_a:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "This job will be run first."

  build_b:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "This job will be run first, in parallel with build_a"

  test_ab:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build_a,build_b]
    steps:
      - run: echo "This job will run after build_a and build_b have finished"

  deploy_ab:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test_ab]
    steps:
      - run: echo "This job will run after test_ab is complete"
````

{% endraw %}

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Scheduling workflows

Both GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} allow you to run workflows at a specific interval. In GitLab CI/CD, pipeline schedules are configured with the UI, while in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} you can trigger a workflow on a scheduled interval with the "on" key.

For more information, see "[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)."

## Variables and secrets

GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} support setting environment variables in the pipeline or workflow configuration file, and creating secrets using the GitLab or {% data variables.product.product_name %} UI.

For more information, see "[Environment variables](/actions/reference/environment-variables)" and "[Encrypted secrets](/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)."

## Caching

GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} provide a method in the configuration file to manually cache workflow files.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
image: node:latest

cache:
key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
paths: - .npm/

before_script:

- npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline

test_async:
script: - node ./specs/start.js ./specs/async.spec.js

````
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  test_async:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: v1-npm-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: v1-npm-deps-
````

{% endraw %}

</td>
</tr>
</table>

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} caching is only applicable to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners. For more information, see "<a href="/actions/guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" class="dotcom-only">Caching dependencies to speed up workflows</a>."

## Artifacts

Both GitLab CI/CD and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can upload files and directories created by a job as artifacts. In {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, artifacts can be used to persist data across multiple jobs.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table>
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
script:
artifacts:
  paths:
    - math-homework.txt
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
- name: Upload math result for job 1
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: homework
    path: math-homework.txt
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

For more information, see "[Storing workflow data as artifacts](/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)."

## Databases and service containers

Both systems enable you to include additional containers for databases, caching, or other dependencies.

In GitLab CI/CD, a container for the job is specified with the `image` key, while {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses the `container` key. In both systems, additional service containers are specified with the `services` key.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system:

<table class="d-block">
<tr>
<th>
GitLab CI/CD
</th>
<th>
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
container-job:
  variables:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    # The hostname used to communicate with the
    # PostgreSQL service container
    POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
    # The default PostgreSQL port
    POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
  image: node:10.18-jessie
  services:
    - postgres
  script:
    # Performs a clean installation of all dependencies
    # in the `package.json` file
    - npm ci
    # Runs a script that creates a PostgreSQL client,
    # populates the client with data, and retrieves data
    - node client.js
  tags:
    - docker
```
{% endraw %}
</td>
<td class="d-table-cell v-align-top">
{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:10.18-jessie

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Performs a clean installation of all dependencies
      # in the `package.json` file
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Connect to PostgreSQL
        # Runs a script that creates a PostgreSQL client,
        # populates the client with data, and retrieves data
        run: node client.js
        env:
          # The hostname used to communicate with the
          # PostgreSQL service container
          POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
          # The default PostgreSQL port
          POSTGRES_PORT: 5432

```
{% endraw %}
