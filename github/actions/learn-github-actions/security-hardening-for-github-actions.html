    <h2 id="using-secrets">Using secrets</h2>
    <p>
      Sensitive values should never be stored as plaintext in workflow files,
      but rather as secrets.
      <a
        href="/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets"
        >Secrets</a
      >
      can be configured at the organization{% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 or
      ghae %}, repository, or environment{% else %} or repository{% endif %}
      level, and allow you to store sensitive information in {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secrets use
      <a
        href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes"
        >Libsodium sealed boxes</a
      >, so that they are encrypted before reaching {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}. This occurs when the secret is
      submitted
      <a
        href="/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository"
        >using the UI</a
      >
      or through the <a href="/rest/reference/actions#secrets">REST API</a>.
      This client-side encryption helps minimize the risks related to accidental
      logging (for example, exception logs and request logs, among others)
      within {% data variables.product.product_name %}’s infrastructure. Once
      the secret is uploaded, {% data variables.product.product_name %} is then
      able to decrypt it so that it can be injected into the workflow runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help prevent accidental disclosure, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} uses a mechanism that attempts to redact
      any secrets that appear in run logs. This redaction looks for exact
      matches of any configured secrets, as well as common encodings of the
      values, such as Base64. However, because there are multiple ways a secret
      value can be transformed, this redaction is not guaranteed. As a result,
      there are certain proactive steps and good practices you should follow to
      help ensure secrets are redacted, and to limit other risks associated with
      secrets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Never use structured data as a secret</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Structured data can cause secret redaction within logs to fail,
            because redaction largely relies on finding an exact match for the
            specific secret value. For example, do not use a blob of JSON, XML,
            or YAML (or similar) to encapsulate a secret value, as this
            significantly reduces the probability the secrets will be properly
            redacted. Instead, create individual secrets for each sensitive
            value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Register all secrets used within workflows</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a secret is used to generate another sensitive value within a
            workflow, that generated value should be formally
            <a
              href="https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/core#setting-a-secret"
              >registered as a secret</a
            >, so that it will be redacted if it ever appears in the logs. For
            example, if using a private key to generate a signed JWT to access a
            web API, be sure to register that JWT as a secret or else it won’t
            be redacted if it ever enters the log output.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registering secrets applies to any sort of transformation/encoding
            as well. If your secret is transformed in some way (such as Base64
            or URL-encoded), be sure to register the new value as a secret too.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audit how secrets are handled</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Audit how secrets are used, to help ensure they’re being handled as
            expected. You can do this by reviewing the source code of the
            repository executing the workflow, and checking any actions used in
            the workflow. For example, check that they’re not sent to unintended
            hosts, or explicitly being printed to log output.
          </li>
          <li>
            View the run logs for your workflow after testing valid/invalid
            inputs, and check that secrets are properly redacted, or not shown.
            It’s not always obvious how a command or tool you’re invoking will
            send errors to <code>STDOUT</code> and <code>STDERR</code>, and
            secrets might subsequently end up in error logs. As a result, it is
            good practice to manually review the workflow logs after testing
            valid and invalid inputs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use credentials that are minimally scoped</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure the credentials being used within workflows have the least
            privileges required, and be mindful that any user with write access
            to your repository has read access to all secrets configured in your
            repository. {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.1 or ghae-next %}
          </li>
          <li>
            Actions can use the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> by accessing it from
            the <code>github.token</code> context. For more information, see “<a
              href="/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context"
              >Context and expression syntax for {% data
              variables.product.prodname_actions %}</a
            >.” You should therefore make sure that the
            <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> is granted the minimum required
            permissions. It’s good security practice to set the default
            permission for the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> to read access only for
            repository contents. The permissions can then be increased, as
            required, for individual jobs within the workflow file. For more
            information, see “<a

              >Authentication in a workflow</a
            >.” {% endif %}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audit and rotate registered secrets</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Periodically review the registered secrets to confirm they are still
            required. Remove those that are no longer needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rotate secrets periodically to reduce the window of time during
            which a compromised secret is valid. {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt;
            3.0 or ghae %}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consider requiring review for access to secrets</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use required reviewers to protect environment secrets. A
            workflow job cannot access environment secrets until approval is
            granted by a reviewer. For more information about storing secrets in
            environments or requiring reviews for environments, see “<a
              href="/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets"
              >Encrypted secrets</a

      Using <code>CODEOWNERS</code> to monitor changes

    <p>
      You can use the <code>CODEOWNERS</code> feature to control how changes are
      made to your workflow files. For example, if all your workflow files are
      stored in <code>.github/workflows</code>, you can add this directory to
      the code owners list, so that any proposed changes to these files will
      first require approval from a designated reviewer.

      <a href="/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action"
        >composite run step</a
      >
      actions, you should always consider whether your code might execute
      untrusted input from attackers. This can occur when an attacker adds
      malicious commands and scripts to a context. When your workflow runs,
      those strings might be interpreted as code which is then executed on the
      runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attackers can add their own malicious content to the
      <a
        href="/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context"
        ><code>github</code> context</a
      >, which should be treated as potentially untrusted input. These contexts
      typically end with <code>body</code>, <code>default_branch</code>,
      <code>email</code>, <code>head_ref</code>, <code>label</code>,
      <code>message</code>, <code>name</code>,
      <code>page_name</code>,<code>ref</code>, and <code>title</code>. For
      example: <code>github.event.issue.title</code>, or
      <code>github.event.pull_request.body</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should ensure that these values do not flow directly into workflows,
      actions, API calls, or anywhere else where they could be interpreted as
      executable code. By adopting the same defensive programming posture you
      would use for any other privileged application code, you can help security
      harden your use of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For
      information on some of the steps an attacker could take, see

        >"Potential impact of a compromised runner</a
      >."
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, there are other less obvious sources of potentially untrusted
      input, such as branch names and email addresses, which can be quite
      flexible in terms of their permitted content. For example,
      <code>zzz";echo${IFS}"hello";#</code> would be a valid branch name and
      would be a possible attack vector for a target repository.

    <p>
      The following sections explain how you can help mitigate the risk of
      script injection.
    </p>
    <h3 id="example-of-a-script-injection-attack">
      Example of a script injection attack
    </h3>
    <p>
      A script injection attack can occur directly within a workflow’s inline
      script. In the following example, an action uses an expression to test the
      validity of a pull request title, but also adds the risk of script
      injection:
    </p>
    <p>{% raw %}</p>
    <pre><code>      - name: Check PR title
        run: |
          title=&quot;${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}&quot;
          if [[ $title =~ ^octocat ]]; then
          echo &quot;PR title starts with &#39;octocat&#39;&quot;
          exit 0
          else
          echo &quot;PR title did not start with &#39;octocat&#39;&quot;
          exit 1
          fi</code></pre>
    <p>{% endraw %}</p>
    <p>
      This example is vulnerable to script injection because the
      <code>run</code> command executes within a temporary shell script on the
      runner. Before the shell script is run, the expressions inside {% raw
      %}<code>${{ }}</code>{% endraw %} are evaluated and then substituted with
      the resulting values, which can make it vulnerable to shell command
      injection.
    </p>
    <p>
      To inject commands into this workflow, the attacker could create a pull
      request with a title of <code>a"; ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"</code>:
    </p>

      />
      <figcaption>Example of script injection in PR title</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this example, the <code>"</code> character is used to interrupt the {%
      raw %}<code>title="${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"</code>{% endraw
      %} statement, allowing the <code>ls</code> command to be executed on the
      runner. You can see the output of the <code>ls</code> command in the log:

      Good practices for mitigating script injection attacks
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are a number of different approaches available to help you mitigate
      the risk of script injection:
    </p>
    <h3 id="using-an-action-instead-of-an-inline-script-recommended">
      Using an action instead of an inline script (recommended)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The recommended approach is to create an action that processes the context
      value as an argument. This approach is not vulnerable to the injection
      attack, as the context value is not used to generate a shell script, but
      is instead passed to the action as an argument:
    </p>
    <p>{% raw %}</p>
    <pre><code>uses: fakeaction/checktitle@v3
with:
    title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code></pre>
    <p>{% endraw %}</p>
    <h3 id="using-an-intermediate-environment-variable">
      Using an intermediate environment variable
    </h3>
    <p>
      For inline scripts, the preferred approach to handling untrusted input is
      to set the value of the expression to an intermediate environment
      variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example uses Bash to process the
      <code>github.event.pull_request.title</code> value as an environment
      variable:
    </p>
    <p>{% raw %}</p>
    <pre><code>      - name: Check PR title
        env:
          TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
        run: |
          if [[ &quot;$TITLE&quot; =~ ^octocat ]]; then
          echo &quot;PR title starts with &#39;octocat&#39;&quot;
          exit 0
          else
          echo &quot;PR title did not start with &#39;octocat&#39;&quot;
          exit 1
          fi</code></pre>
    <p>{% endraw %}</p>
    <p>In this example, the attempted script injection is unsuccessful:</p>
    <figure>

        alt="Example of mitigated script injection"
      />
      <figcaption>Example of mitigated script injection</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      With this approach, the value of the {% raw %}<code
        >${{ github.event.issue.title }}</code
      >{% endraw %} expression is stored in memory and used as a variable, and
      doesn’t interact with the script generation process. In addition, consider
      using double quote shell variables to avoid
      <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086"

    <h2 id="using-third-party-actions">Using third-party actions</h2>
    <p>
      The individual jobs in a workflow can interact with (and compromise) other
      jobs. For example, a job querying the environment variables used by a
      later job, writing files to a shared directory that a later job processes,
      or even more directly by interacting with the Docker socket and inspecting
      other running containers and executing commands in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that a compromise of a single action within a workflow can be
      very significant, as that compromised action would have access to all
      secrets configured on your repository, and may be able to use the
      <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> to write to the repository. Consequently, there
      is significant risk in sourcing actions from third-party repositories on

        <p><strong>Pin actions to a full length commit SHA</strong></p>

          Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only
          way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular
          SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the
          action’s repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision
          for a valid Git object payload.

        <p>
          <strong>Warning:</strong> The short version of the commit SHA is
          insecure and should never be used for specifying an action’s Git
          reference. Because of how repository networks work, any user can fork
          the repository and push a crafted commit to it that collides with the
          short SHA. This causes subsequent clones at that SHA to fail because
          it becomes an ambiguous commit. As a result, any workflows that use
          the shortened SHA will immediately fail.

        <p><strong>Audit the source code of the action</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ensure that the action is handling the content of your repository and
          secrets as expected. For example, check that secrets are not sent to
          unintended hosts, or are not inadvertently logged.

          <strong>Pin actions to a tag only if you trust the creator</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although pinning to a commit SHA is the most secure option, specifying
          a tag is more convenient and is widely used. If you’d like to specify
          a tag, then be sure that you trust the action’s creators. The
          ‘Verified creator’ badge on {% data
          variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} is a useful signal, as it
          indicates that the action was written by a team whose identity has
          been verified by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. Note
          that there is risk to this approach even if you trust the author,
          because a tag can be moved or deleted if a bad actor gains access to
          the repository storing the action.

      Workflows triggered using the <code>pull_request</code> event have
      read-only permissions and have no access to secrets. However, these
      permissions differ for various event triggers such as
      <code>issue_comment</code>, <code>issues</code> and <code>push</code>,
      where the attacker could attempt to steal repository secrets or use the
      write permission of the job’s

      </li>
      <li>
        If the secret is used directly in an expression, the generated shell
        script is stored on-disk and is accessible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a custom action, the risk can vary depending on how a program is
          using the secret it obtained from the argument:

        <p>{% raw %}</p>
        <pre><code>uses: fakeaction/publish@v3

    </ul>
    <p>
      Although {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} scrubs secrets from
      memory that are not referenced in the workflow (or an included action),
      the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and any referenced secrets can be harvested
      by a determined attacker.

      <a href="/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#accessing-your-secrets"

      intentionally sent to the log. For example, obfuscated secrets can be
      exfiltrated using
      <code>echo ${SOME_SECRET:0:4}; echo ${SOME_SECRET:4:200};</code>. In
      addition, since the attacker may run arbitrary commands, they could use
      HTTP requests to send secrets or other repository data to an external

      Stealing the job’s <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>

    <p>
      It is possible for an attacker to steal a job’s <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>.
      The {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} runner automatically
      receives a generated <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> with permissions that are
      limited to just the repository that contains the workflow, and the token
      expires after the job has completed. Once expired, the token is no longer
      useful to an attacker. To work around this limitation, they can automate
      the attack and perform it in fractions of a second by calling an
      attacker-controlled server with the token, for example:

    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is intentionally scoped for
      a single repository at a time. The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> grants the
      same level of access as a write-access user, because any write-access user
      can access this token by creating or modifying a workflow file{% ifversion
      fpt or ghes &gt; 3.1 or ghae-next %}, elevating the permissions of the
      <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> if necessary{% endif %}. Users have specific
      permissions for each repository, so allowing the
      <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> for one repository to grant access to another
      would impact the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} permission
      model if not implemented carefully. Similarly, caution must be taken when
      adding {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} authentication tokens
      to a workflow, because this can also affect the {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} permission model by inadvertently
      granting broad access to collaborators.

    <p>
      We have

      >
      to support a flow that allows cross-repository access within {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}, but this is not yet a supported
      feature. Currently, the only way to perform privileged cross-repository
      interactions is to place a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}
      authentication token or SSH key as a secret within the workflow. Because
      many authentication token types do not allow for granular access to
      specific resources, there is significant risk in using the wrong token
      type, as it can grant much broader access than intended.

    <p>
      This list describes the recommended approaches for accessing repository
      data within a workflow, in descending order of preference:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This token is intentionally scoped to the single repository that
            invoked the workflow, and {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.1 or
            ghae-next %}can have {% else %}has {% endif %}the same level of
            access as a write-access user on the repository. The token is
            created before each job begins and expires when the job is finished.
            For more information, see “<a
              href="/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token"
              >Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN</a
            >.”
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> should be used whenever possible.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repository deploy key</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deploy keys are one of the only credential types that grant read or
            write access to a single repository, and can be used to interact
            with another repository within a workflow. For more information, see
            “<a href="/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys"
              >Managing deploy keys</a
            >.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that deploy keys can only clone and push to the repository
            using Git, and cannot be used to interact with the REST or GraphQL
            API, so they may not be appropriate for your requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>{% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} tokens</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} can be installed
            on select repositories, and even have granular permissions on the
            resources within them. You could create a {% data
            variables.product.prodname_github_app %} internal to your
            organization, install it on the repositories you need access to
            within your workflow, and authenticate as the installation within
            your workflow to access those repositories.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Personal access tokens</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You should never use personal access tokens from your own account.
            These tokens grant access to all repositories within the
            organizations that you have access to, as well as all personal
            repositories in your user account. This indirectly grants broad
            access to all write-access users of the repository the workflow is
            in. In addition, if you later leave an organization, workflows using
            this token will immediately break, and debugging this issue can be
            challenging.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a personal access token is used, it should be one that was
            generated for a new account that is only granted access to the
            specific repositories that are needed for the workflow. Note that
            this approach is not scalable and should be avoided in favor of
            alternatives, such as deploy keys.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SSH keys on a user account</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Workflows should never use the SSH keys on a user account. Similar
            to personal access tokens, they grant read/write permissions to all
            of your personal repositories as well as all the repositories you
            have access to through organization membership. This indirectly
            grants broad access to all write-access users of the repository the
            workflow is in. If you’re intending to use an SSH key because you
            only need to perform repository clones or pushes, and do not need to
            interact with public APIs, then you should use individual deploy
            keys instead.

      Hardening for self-hosted runners
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted</strong>
      runners execute code within ephemeral and clean isolated virtual machines,
      meaning there is no way to persistently compromise this environment, or
      otherwise gain access to more information than was placed in this
      environment during the bootstrap process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-hosted</strong> runners on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} do not have guarantees around running in
      ephemeral clean virtual machines, and can be persistently compromised by
      untrusted code in a workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, self-hosted runners should almost
      <a
        href="/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security-with-public-repositories"
        >never be used for public repositories</a
      >
      on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, because any user can open
      pull requests against the repository and compromise the environment.
      Similarly, be cautious when using self-hosted runners on private
      repositories, as anyone who can fork the repository and open a pull
      request (generally those with read-access to the repository) are able to
      compromise the self-hosted runner environment, including gaining access to
      secrets and the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> which{% ifversion fpt or ghes
      &gt; 3.1 or ghae-next %}, depending on its settings, can grant {% else %}
      grants {% endif %}write-access permissions on the repository. Although
      workflows can control access to environment secrets by using environments
      and required reviews, these workflows are not run in an isolated
      environment and are still susceptible to the same risks when run on a
      self-hosted runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a self-hosted runner is defined at the organization or enterprise
      level, {% data variables.product.product_name %} can schedule workflows
      from multiple repositories onto the same runner. Consequently, a security
      compromise of these environments can result in a wide impact. To help
      reduce the scope of a compromise, you can create boundaries by organizing
      your self-hosted runners into separate groups. For more information, see
      “<a
        href="/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups"
        >Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also consider the environment of the self-hosted runner
      machines: - What sensitive information resides on the machine configured
      as a self-hosted runner? For example, private SSH keys, API access tokens,
      among others. - Does the machine have network access to sensitive
      services? For example, Azure or AWS metadata services. The amount of
      sensitive information in this environment should be kept to a minimum, and
      you should always be mindful that any user capable of invoking workflows
      has access to this environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some customers might attempt to partially mitigate these risks by
      implementing systems that automatically destroy the self-hosted runner
      after each job execution. However, this approach might not be as effective
      as intended, as there is no way to guarantee that a self-hosted runner
      only runs one job. Some jobs will use secrets as command-line arguments
      which can be seen by another job running on the same runner, such as
      <code>ps x -w</code>. This can lead to secret leakages.
