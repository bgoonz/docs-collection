## About {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} groups

{% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} groups are used to control access to {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s at the organization and enterprise level. Enterprise admins can configure access policies that control which organizations in an enterprise have access to the runner group. Organization admins can configure access policies that control which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.

When an enterprise admin grants an organization access to a runner group, organization admins can see the runner group listed in the organization's {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} settings. The organizations admins can then assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise runner group.

When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the default group. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move runners from the default group to another group. For more information, see "[Moving an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} to a group](#moving-an-ae-hosted-runner-to-a-group)."

## Creating an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group for an organization

All organizations have a single default {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group. Organizations within an enterprise account can create additional runner groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group.

{% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories have access to the runner group.

{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions %}

1. In the **Self-hosted runners** section, click **Add new**, and then **New group**.

1. Enter a name for your runner group, and assign a policy for repository access.

   You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of repositories, or to all repositories in the organization. By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this.

## Creating an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group for an enterprise

Enterprises can add their {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s to groups for access management. Enterprises can create groups of {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s that are accessible to specific organizations in the enterprise account. Organization admins can then assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise runner groups.

{% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can assign the runner to a specific group during the registration process, or you can later move the runner from the default group to a custom group.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which organizations have access to the runner group.
