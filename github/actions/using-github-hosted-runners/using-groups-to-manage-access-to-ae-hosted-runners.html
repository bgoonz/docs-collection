      About {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} groups
    </h2>
    <p>
      {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} groups are used to control
      access to {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s at the organization
      and enterprise level. Enterprise admins can configure access policies that
      control which organizations in an enterprise have access to the runner
      group. Organization admins can configure access policies that control
      which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an enterprise admin grants an organization access to a runner group,
      organization admins can see the runner group listed in the organization’s
      {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} settings. The organizations
      admins can then assign additional granular repository access policies to
      the enterprise runner group.
    </p>
    <p>
      When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the
      default group. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move
      runners from the default group to another group. For more information, see
      “<a href="#moving-an-ae-hosted-runner-to-a-group"

      Creating an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group for an
      organization
    </h2>
    <p>
      All organizations have a single default {% data
      variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group. Organizations within an
      enterprise account can create additional runner groups. Organization
      admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are automatically assigned to
      the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a
      time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you
      create.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which
      repositories have access to the runner group.

          You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list

          group, but you can override this.

      Creating an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} group for an

    </h2>
    <p>
      Enterprises can add their {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s to
      groups for access management. Enterprises can create groups of {% data
      variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s that are accessible to specific
      organizations in the enterprise account. Organization admins can then
      assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise
      runner groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are automatically assigned to
      the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a
      time. You can assign the runner to a specific group during the
      registration process, or you can later move the runner from the default
      group to a custom group.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which
      organizations have access to the runner group.
