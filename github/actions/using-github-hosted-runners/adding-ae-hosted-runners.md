{% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s can use the base Azure operating system images, or you can create your own custom images.

## Adding an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} from the base Azure image

You can add {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s that use the base Azure operating system images.

- Required operating system: Available options are listed at ["Software specifications](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-ae-hosted-runners#software-specifications)."
- Choose a name for each pool of {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s. These names are created as labels, allowing you to route your workflows to these runners. For more information, see ["Using {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s in a workflow](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-ae-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)."
- Where to add the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}: Identify the names of the organizations and enterprises that will receive the runners.

## Adding an {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} with a custom image

To create a custom operating system image, see the steps at ["Creating custom images"](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/creating-custom-images).

- Type of operating system used by the image: This can be Linux or Windows.
