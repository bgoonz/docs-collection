      The custom label is created and assigned to the self-hosted runner. Custom
      labels can be removed from self-hosted runners, but they currently can’t

      Using the configuration script to create and assign labels
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can use the configuration script on the self-hosted runner to create
      and assign custom labels. For example, this command assigns a label named
      <code>gpu</code> to the self-hosted runner.
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>./config.sh --labels gpu</code></pre>
    <p>
      The label is created if it does not already exist. You can also use this
      approach to assign the default labels to runners, such as
      <code>x64</code> or <code>linux</code>. When default labels are assigned
      using the configuration script, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions
      %} accepts them as given and does not validate that the runner is actually
      using that operating system or architecture.
    </p>
    <p>You can use comma separation to assign multiple labels. For example:</p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>./config.sh --labels gpu,x64,linux</code></pre>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      ** Note:** If you replace an existing runner, then you must reassign any
      custom labels.
