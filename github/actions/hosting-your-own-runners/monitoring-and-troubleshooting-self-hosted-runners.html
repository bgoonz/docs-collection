* **Active**: The runner is currently executing a job.
* **Offline**: The runner is not connected to {% data variables.product.product_name %}. This could be because the machine is offline, the self-hosted runner application is not running on the machine, or the self-hosted runner application cannot communicate with {% data variables.product.product_name %}.</code></pre>

      You can monitor the status of the self-hosted runner application and its
      activities. Log files are kept in the <code>_diag</code> directory, and a
      new one is generated each time the application is started. The filename
      begins with <em>Runner_</em>, and is followed by a UTC timestamp of when
      the application was started.

      The self-hosted runner application creates a detailed log file for each

      Using journalctl to check the self-hosted runner application service
    </h2>
    <p>
      For Linux-based self-hosted runners running the application using a
      service, you can use <code>journalctl</code> to monitor their real-time
      activity. The default systemd-based service uses the following naming
      convention:
      <code
        >actions.runner.&lt;org&gt;-&lt;repo&gt;.&lt;runnerName&gt;.service</code
      >. This name is truncated if it exceeds 80 characters, so the preferred
      way of finding the service’s name is by checking the
      <em>.service</em> file. For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ cat ~/actions-runner/.service
actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can use <code>journalctl</code> to monitor the real-time activity of
      the self-hosted runner:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ sudo journalctl -u actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service -f</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example output, you can see <code>runner01</code> start, receive a
      job named <code>testAction</code>, and then display the resulting status:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>Feb 11 14:57:07 runner01 runsvc.sh[962]: Starting Runner listener with startup type: service

    <p>
      To view the systemd configuration, you can locate the service file here:
      <code
        >/etc/systemd/system/actions.runner.&lt;org&gt;-&lt;repo&gt;.&lt;runnerName&gt;.service</code
      >. If you want to customize the self-hosted runner application service, do
      not directly modify this file. Follow the instructions described in “<a

      Using launchd to check the self-hosted runner application service
    </h2>
    <p>
      For macOS-based self-hosted runners running the application as a service,
      you can use <code>launchctl</code> to monitor their real-time activity.
      The default launchd-based service uses the following naming convention:
      <code>actions.runner.&lt;org&gt;-&lt;repo&gt;.&lt;runnerName&gt;</code>.
      This name is truncated if it exceeds 80 characters, so the preferred way
      of finding the service’s name is by checking the <em>.service</em> file in
      the runner directory:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>% cat ~/actions-runner/.service
/Users/exampleUsername/Library/LaunchAgents/actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.plist</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <code>svc.sh</code> script uses <code>launchctl</code> to check
      whether the application is running. For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ ./svc.sh status
status actions.runner.example.runner01:
/Users/exampleUsername/Library/LaunchAgents/actions.runner.example.runner01.plist
Started:
379 0 actions.runner.example.runner01</code></pre>
    <p>
      The resulting output includes the process ID and the name of the
      application’s launchd service.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view the launchd configuration, you can locate the service file here:
      <code
        >/Users/exampleUsername/Library/LaunchAgents/actions.runner.&lt;repoName&gt;.&lt;runnerName&gt;.service</code
      >. If you want to customize the self-hosted runner application service, do
      not directly modify this file. Follow the instructions described in “<a

      Using PowerShell to check the self-hosted runner application service
    </h2>
    <p>
      For Windows-based self-hosted runners running the application as a
      service, you can use PowerShell to monitor their real-time activity. The
      service uses the naming convention
      <code
        >GitHub Actions Runner
        (&lt;org&gt;-&lt;repo&gt;.&lt;runnerName&gt;)</code
      >. You can also find the service’s name by checking the
      <em>.service</em> file in the runner directory:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>PS C:\actions-runner&gt; Get-Content .service
actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can view the status of the runner in the Windows
      <em>Services</em> application (<code>services.msc</code>). You can also
      use PowerShell to check whether the service is running:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>PS C:\actions-runner&gt; Get-Service &quot;actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service&quot; | Select-Object Name, Status

actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service    Running</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can use PowerShell to check the recent activity of the self-hosted
      runner. In this example output, you can see the application start, receive
      a job named <code>testAction</code>, and then display the resulting
      status:
    </p>

      Monitoring the automatic update process
    </h2>
    <p>
      We recommend that you regularly check the automatic update process, as the
      self-hosted runner will not be able to process jobs if it falls below a
      certain version threshold. The self-hosted runner application
      automatically updates itself, but note that this process does not include
      any updates to the operating system or other software; you will need to
      separately manage these updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can view the update activities in the <em>Runner_</em> log files. For
      example:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>[Feb 12 12:37:07 INFO SelfUpdater] An update is available.</code></pre>
    <p>
      In addition, you can find more information in the <em>SelfUpdate</em> log
      files located in the <code>_diag</code> directory.

    <h3 id="checking-that-docker-is-installed">
      Checking that Docker is installed
    </h3>
    <p>
      If your jobs require containers, then the self-hosted runner must be
      Linux-based and needs to have Docker installed. Check that your
      self-hosted runner has Docker installed and that the service is running.
    </p>
    <p>You can use <code>systemctl</code> to check the service status:</p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>$ sudo systemctl is-active docker.service
active</code></pre>
    <p>
      If Docker is not installed, then dependent actions will fail with the
      following errors:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>[2020-02-13 16:56:10Z INFO DockerCommandManager] Which: &#39;docker&#39;

    <pre

    ><code>dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied</code></pre>
    <p>
      Check that the self-hosted runner’s service account has permission to use
      the Docker service. You can identify this account by checking the
      configuration of the self-hosted runner in systemd. For example:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ sudo systemctl show -p User actions.runner.octo-org-octo-repo.runner01.service
User=runner-user</code></pre>
