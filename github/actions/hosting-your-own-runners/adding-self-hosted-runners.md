You can add a self-hosted runner to a repository, an organization, or an enterprise.

If you are an organization or enterprise administrator, you might want to add your self-hosted runners at the organization or enterprise level. This approach makes the runner available to multiple repositories in your organization or enterprise, and also lets you to manage your runners in one place.

For information on supported operating systems for self-hosted runners, or using self-hosted runners with a proxy server, see "[About self-hosted runners](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners)."

## Adding a self-hosted runner to a repository

You can add self-hosted runners to a single repository. To add a self-hosted runner to a user repository, you must be the repository owner. For an organization repository, you must be an organization owner or have admin access to the repository.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.github-actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runners %}

1. Under {% ifversion fpt %}"Runners"{% else %}"Self-hosted runners"{% endif %}, click **Add runner**.
   {% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-configure %}
   {% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-check-installation-success %}

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an organization

You can add self-hosted runners at the organization level, where they can be used to process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization. To add a self-hosted runner to an organization, you must be an organization owner.

{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.github-actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runners %}

1. Under {% ifversion fpt %}"Runners"{% else %}"Self-hosted runners"{% endif %}, click **Add runner**.
   {% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-configure %}
   {% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-check-installation-success %}

{% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-public-repo-access %}

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an enterprise

You can add self-hosted runners to an enterprise, where they can be assigned to multiple organizations. The organization admins are then able to control which repositories can use it.

{% ifversion fpt %}
To add a self-hosted runner to an enterprise account, you must be an enterprise owner.
{% elsif ghes > 2.21 or ghae %}
To add a self-hosted runner at the enterprise level of {% data variables.product.product_location %}, you must be a site administrator.

1. Click **Add new**, then click **New runner**. New runners are assigned to the default group. You can modify the runner's group after you've registered the runner.

### Making enterprise runners available to repositories

By default, runners in an enterprise's "Default" self-hosted runner group are available to all organizations in the enterprise, but are not available to all repositories in each organization.

To make an enterprise-level self-hosted runner group available to an organization repository, you might need to change the organization's inherited settings for the runner group to make the runner available to repositories in the organization.

For more information on changing runner group access settings, see "[Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-the-access-policy-of-a-self-hosted-runner-group)."
