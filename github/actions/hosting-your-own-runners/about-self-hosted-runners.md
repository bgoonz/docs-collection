## About self-hosted runners

{% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-description %} Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.

You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management hierarchy:

- Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository.
- Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization.
- Enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.

Your runner machine connects to {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} self-hosted runner application. {% data reusables.github-actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

{% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-auto-removal %}

For more information about installing and using self-hosted runners, see "[Adding self-hosted runners](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)" and "[Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)."

## Differences between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted and self-hosted runners

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners offer a quicker, simpler way to run your workflows, while self-hosted runners are a highly configurable way to run workflows in your own custom environment.

**{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners:**

- Receive automatic updates for the operating system, preinstalled packages and tools, and the self-hosted runner application.
- Are managed and maintained by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
- Provide a clean instance for every job execution.
- Use free minutes on your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan, with per-minute rates applied after surpassing the free minutes.

**Self-hosted runners:**

- Receive automatic updates for the self-hosted runner application only. You are responsible for updating the operating system and all other software.
- Can use cloud services or local machines that you already pay for.
- Are customizable to your hardware, operating system, software, and security requirements.
- Don't need to have a clean instance for every job execution.
- Are free to use with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, but you are responsible for the cost of maintaining your runner machines.

## Requirements for self-hosted runner machines

You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these requirements:

- You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the machine. For more information, see "[Supported architectures and operating systems for self-hosted runners](#supported-architectures-and-operating-systems-for-self-hosted-runners)."
- The machine can communicate with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "[Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](#communication-between-self-hosted-runners-and-github)."
- The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires minimal resources.
- If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be installed.

## Usage limits

There are some limits on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.

{% data reusables.github-actions.usage-workflow-run-time %}

- **Job queue time** - Each job for self-hosted runners can be queued for a maximum of 24 hours. If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.
  {% data reusables.github-actions.usage-api-requests %}
- **Job matrix** - {% data reusables.github-actions.usage-matrix-limits %}
  {% data reusables.github-actions.usage-workflow-queue-limits %}

{% ifversion ghes %}

## Supported actions on self-hosted runners

Some extra configuration might be required to use actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, or to use the `actions/setup-LANGUAGE` actions with self-hosted runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see "[Managing access to actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}](/enterprise/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom)" and contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} site administrator.

{% endif %}

## Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}

The self-hosted runner polls {% data variables.product.product_name %} to retrieve application updates and to check if any jobs are queued for processing. The self-hosted runner uses a HTTPS _long poll_ that opens a connection to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for 50 seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept and run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs.

{% ifversion ghae %}
You must ensure that the self-hosted runner has appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} URL.
For example, if your instance name is `octoghae`, then you will need to allow the self-hosted runner to access `octoghae.github.com`.

If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account, you must add your self-hosted runner's IP address to the allow list. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} URLs listed below.

{% note %}

**Note:** Some of the domains listed below are configured using `CNAME` records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all `CNAME` records. Note that the `CNAME` records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

```
github.com
api.github.com
*.actions.githubusercontent.com
github-releases.githubusercontent.com
github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com
codeload.github.com
*.pkg.github.com
pkg-cache.githubusercontent.com
pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com
pkg-containers-az.githubusercontent.com
```

If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account, you must add your self-hosted runner's IP address to the allow list. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)" or "[Enforcing security settings in your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/enforcing-security-settings-in-your-enterprise-account#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)".

{% else %}

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with {% data variables.product.product_location %}.

{% endif %}

You can also use self-hosted runners with a proxy server. For more information, see "[Using a proxy server with self-hosted runners](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-a-proxy-server-with-self-hosted-runners)."

## Self-hosted runner security with public repositories

{% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}

This is not an issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners because each {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution.

Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if your machine persists its environment between jobs. Some of the risks include:

- Malicious programs running on the machine.
- Escaping the machine's runner sandbox.
- Exposing access to the machine's network environment.
- Persisting unwanted or dangerous data on the machine.
