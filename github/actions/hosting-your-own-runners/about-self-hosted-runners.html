    <p>
      {% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-description %}
      Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises,
      or in a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management
      hierarchy: - Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single
      repository. - Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple
      repositories in an organization. - Enterprise-level runners can be
      assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your runner machine connects to {% data variables.product.product_name %}
      using the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} self-hosted runner
      application. {% data reusables.github-actions.runner-app-open-source %}
      When a new version is released, the runner application automatically
      updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of
      release if the runner hasn’t been assigned any jobs.

      Differences between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted
      and self-hosted runners
    </h2>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners offer a
      quicker, simpler way to run your workflows, while self-hosted runners are
      a highly configurable way to run workflows in your own custom environment.

      - Receive automatic updates for the operating system, preinstalled
      packages and tools, and the self-hosted runner application. - Are managed
      and maintained by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. - Provide
      a clean instance for every job execution. - Use free minutes on your {%
      data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan, with per-minute rates
      applied after surpassing the free minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-hosted runners:</strong> - Receive automatic updates for the
      self-hosted runner application only. You are responsible for updating the
      operating system and all other software. - Can use cloud services or local
      machines that you already pay for. - Are customizable to your hardware,
      operating system, software, and security requirements. - Don’t need to
      have a clean instance for every job execution. - Are free to use with {%
      data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, but you are responsible for
      the cost of maintaining your runner machines.

      Requirements for self-hosted runner machines
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these
      requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the
        machine. For more information, see “<a
          href="#supported-architectures-and-operating-systems-for-self-hosted-runners"
          >Supported architectures and operating systems for self-hosted
          runners</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        The machine can communicate with {% data
        variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see “<a
          href="#communication-between-self-hosted-runners-and-github"
          >Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data
          variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you
        plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires
        minimal resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or
        service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be
        installed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="usage-limits">Usage limits</h2>
    <p>
      There are some limits on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
      usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.

      Supported actions on self-hosted runners

      Some extra configuration might be required to use actions from {% data

      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, or to use the
      <code>actions/setup-LANGUAGE</code> actions with self-hosted runners that

    >
      Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}
    </h2>
    <p>
      The self-hosted runner polls {% data variables.product.product_name %} to
      retrieve application updates and to check if any jobs are queued for
      processing. The self-hosted runner uses a HTTPS <em>long poll</em> that
      opens a connection to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for 50
      seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a
      new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept
      and run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion ghae %} You must ensure that the self-hosted runner has
      appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} URL. For example, if your
      instance name is <code>octoghae</code>, then you will need to allow the
      self-hosted runner to access <code>octoghae.github.com</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account,
      you must add your self-hosted runner’s IP address to the allow list. For
      more information, see “<a

    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Some of the domains listed below are configured
      using <code>CNAME</code> records. Some firewalls might require you to add

    <p>{% data reusables.github-actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}</p>
    <p>
      This is not an issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %}-hosted runners because each {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %}-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is
      destroyed at the end of the job execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant
      security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if
      your machine persists its environment between jobs. Some of the risks
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Malicious programs running on the machine.</li>
      <li>Escaping the machine’s runner sandbox.</li>
      <li>Exposing access to the machine’s network environment.</li>
      <li>Persisting unwanted or dangerous data on the machine.</li>
