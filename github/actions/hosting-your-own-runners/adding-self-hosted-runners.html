      You can add a self-hosted runner to a repository, an organization, or an
      enterprise.

      If you are an organization or enterprise administrator, you might want to
      add your self-hosted runners at the organization or enterprise level. This
      approach makes the runner available to multiple repositories in your
      organization or enterprise, and also lets you to manage your runners in
      one place.

      Making enterprise runners available to repositories
    </h3>
    <p>
      By default, runners in an enterprise’s “Default” self-hosted runner group
      are available to all organizations in the enterprise, but are not
      available to all repositories in each organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make an enterprise-level self-hosted runner group available to an
      organization repository, you might need to change the organization’s
      inherited settings for the runner group to make the runner available to
      repositories in the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
