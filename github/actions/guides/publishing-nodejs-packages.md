## Introduction

This guide shows you how to create a workflow that publishes Node.js packages to the {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} and npm registries after continuous integration (CI) tests pass. With a single workflow, you can publish packages to a single registry or multiple registries.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that you have a basic understanding of workflow configuration options and how to create a workflow file. For more information, see "[Learn {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions)."

For more information about creating a CI workflow for your Node.js project, see "[Using Node.js with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-nodejs-with-github-actions)."

You may also find it helpful to have a basic understanding of the following:

- "[Working with the npm registry](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry)"
- "[Environment variables](/actions/reference/environment-variables)"
- "[Encrypted secrets](/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)"
- "[Authentication in a workflow](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow)"

## About package configuration

The `name` and `version` fields in the _package.json_ file create a unique identifier that registries use to link your package to a registry. You can add a summary for the package listing page by including a `description` field in the _package.json_ file. For more information, see "[Creating a package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)" and "[Creating Node.js modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules)" in the npm documentation.

When a local _.npmrc_ file exists and has a `registry` value specified, the `npm publish` command uses the registry configured in the _.npmrc_ file. {% data reusables.github-actions.setup-node-intro %}

You can specify the Node.js version installed on the runner using the `setup-node` action.

If you add steps in your workflow to configure the `publishConfig` fields in your _package.json_ file, you don't need to specify the registry-url using the `setup-node` action, but you will be limited to publishing the package to one registry. For more information, see "[publishConfig](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#publishconfig)" in the npm documentation.

## Publishing packages to the npm registry

Each time you create a new release, you can trigger a workflow to publish your package. The workflow in the example below runs when the `release` event triggers with type `created`. The workflow publishes the package to the npm registry if CI tests pass.

To perform authenticated operations against the npm registry in your workflow, you'll need to store your npm authentication token as a secret. For example, create a repository secret called `NPM_TOKEN`. For more information, see "[Creating and using encrypted secrets](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets)."

By default, npm uses the `name` field of the _package.json_ file to determine the npm registry. When publishing to a global namespace, you only need to include the package name. For example, you would publish a package named `npm-hello-world-test` to the `https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-hello-world-test`.

If you're publishing a package that includes a scope prefix, include the scope in the name of your _package.json_ file. For example, if your npm scope prefix is octocat and the package name is hello-world, the `name` in your _package.json_ file should be `@octocat/hello-world`. If your npm package uses a scope prefix and the package is public, you need to use the option `npm publish --access public`. This is an option that npm requires to prevent someone from publishing a private package unintentionally.

This example stores the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. When the `setup-node` action creates an _.npmrc_ file, it references the token from the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

{% raw %}

```yaml{:copy}
name: Node.js Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to npm
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

{% endraw %}

In the example above, the `setup-node` action creates an _.npmrc_ file on the runner with the following contents:

```ini
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
always-auth=true
```

## Publishing packages to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

Each time you create a new release, you can trigger a workflow to publish your package. The workflow in the example below runs anytime the `release` event with type `created` occurs. The workflow publishes the package to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} if CI tests pass.

### Configuring the destination repository

If you don't provide the `repository` key in your _package.json_ file, then {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} publishes a package in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository you specify in the `name` field of the _package.json_ file. For example, a package named `@my-org/test` is published to the `my-org/test` {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository.

However, if you do provide the `repository` key, then the repository in that key is used as the destination npm registry for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. For example, publishing the below _package.json_ results in a package named `my-amazing-package` published to the `octocat/my-other-repo` {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository.

```json
{
  "name": "@octocat/my-amazing-package",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/octocat/my-other-repo.git"
  },
```

### Authenticating to the destination repository

To perform authenticated operations against the {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registry in your workflow, you can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. {% data reusables.github-actions.github-token-permissions %}

If you want to publish your package to a different repository, you must use a personal access token (PAT) that has permission to write to packages in the destination repository. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)" and "[Encrypted secrets](/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)."

### Example workflow

This example stores the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret in the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. When the `setup-node` action creates an _.npmrc_ file, it references the token from the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

```yaml{:copy}
name: Node.js Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write {% endif %}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to GitHub Packages
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
          # Defaults to the user or organization that owns the workflow file
          scope: '@octocat'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
```

The `setup-node` action creates an _.npmrc_ file on the runner. When you use the `scope` input to the `setup-node` action, the _.npmrc_ file includes the scope prefix. By default, the `setup-node` action sets the scope in the _.npmrc_ file to the account that contains that workflow file.

```ini
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}
@octocat:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
always-auth=true
```

## Publishing packages using yarn

If you use the Yarn package manager, you can install and publish packages using Yarn.

{% raw %}

```yaml{:copy}
name: Node.js Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to npm
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
          # Defaults to the user or organization that owns the workflow file
          scope: '@octocat'
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

{% endraw %}

## Publishing packages to npm and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

{% note %}

**Note:** If you need to publish to registries that have different scope prefixes, you'll need to modify the _package.json_ file on the runner to change the scope prefix. For example, if you publish a package to the `@mona` scope for npm and `@octocat` scope for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, you can replace the `@mona` scope with `@octocat` in the _package.json_ file on the runner after publishing to npm and before publishing to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.

{% endnote %}

You can publish your packages to both the npm registry and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} by using the `setup-node` action for each registry.

If you publish a package to both registries, you'll need to ensure that your scope prefix on npm matches your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user or organization name. To publish packages to a public registry with a scope prefix, you can use the command `npm publish --access public`. For more information, see [`npm-scope`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) and "[Creating and publishing scoped public packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages)" in the npm documentation.

Ensure your _package.json_ file includes the scope of your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository and npm registry. For example, if you plan to publish a package in the `octocat/npm-hello-world-test` repository to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octocat/npm-hello-world-test, the name in your _package.json_ file would be `"name": "@octocat/npm-hello-world-test"`.

To perform authenticated operations against the {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registry in your workflow, you can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. {% data reusables.github-actions.github-token-permissions %}

When you use the `scope` input to the `setup-node` action, the action creates an _.npmrc_ file that includes the scope prefix. By default, the `setup-node` action sets the scope in the _.npmrc_ file to the user or organization that owns the workflow file.

This workflow calls the `setup-node` action two times. Each time the `setup-node` action runs, it overwrites the _.npmrc_ file. The _.npmrc_ file references the token that allows you to perform authenticated operations against the package registry from the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. The workflow sets the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable each time the `npm publish` command is run, first with a token to publish to npm (`NPM_TOKEN`) and then with a token to publish to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} (`GITHUB_TOKEN`).

```yaml{:copy}
name: Node.js Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae-next %}
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write {% endif %}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to npm
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '10.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
      - run: npm install
      # Publish to npm
      - run: npm publish --access public
        env:{% raw %}
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to GitHub Packages
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
          # Defaults to the user or organization that owns the workflow file
          scope: '@octocat'
      # Publish to GitHub Packages
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
```
