    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial demonstrates how to use the
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/simple-issue-labeler"
        ><code>andymckay/labeler</code> action</a
      >
      along with a conditional to remove a label from issues and pull requests
      that are added to a specific column on a project board. For example, you
      can remove the <code>needs review</code> label when project cards are
      moved into the <code>Done</code> column.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tutorial, you will first make a workflow file that uses the
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/simple-issue-labeler"
        ><code>andymckay/labeler</code> action</a
      >. Then, you will customize the workflow to suit your needs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="creating-the-workflow">Creating the workflow</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>{% data reusables.actions.choose-repo %}</li>
      <li>
        Choose a project that belongs to the repository. This workflow cannot be
        used with projects that belong to users or organizations. You can use an
        existing project, or you can create a new project. For more information
        about creating a project, see “<a
          href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board"
          >Creating a project board</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>{% data reusables.actions.make-workflow-file %}</li>
      <li>
        <p>Copy the following YAML contents into your workflow file.</p>
        <pre
          class="yaml{:copy}"
        ><code>{% indented_data_reference reusables.actions.actions-not-certified-by-github-comment spaces=4 %}

        uses: andymckay/labeler@5c59dabdfd4dd5bd9c6e6d255b01b9d764af4414
        with:
          remove-labels: &quot;needs review&quot;
          repo-token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Customize the parameters in your workflow file:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <code>github.event.project_card.column_id == '12345678'</code>,
            replace <code>12345678</code> with the ID of the column where you
            want to un-label issues and pull requests that are moved there.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To find the column ID, navigate to your project board. Next to the
          title of the column, click {% octicon “kebab-horizontal”
          aria-label=“The horizontal kebab icon” %} then click
          <strong>Copy column link</strong>. The column ID is the number at the
          end of the copied link. For example, <code>24687531</code> is the
          column ID for
          <code
            >https://github.com/octocat/octo-repo/projects/1#column-24687531</code
          >.
        </p>
        If you want to act on more than one column, separate the conditions with
        <code>||</code>. For example,
        <code
          >if github.event.project_card.column_id == '12345678' ||
          github.event.project_card.column_id == '87654321'</code
        >
        will act whenever a project card is added to column
        <code>12345678</code> or column <code>87654321</code>. The columns may
        be on different project boards.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>remove-labels</code> to the list of
            labels that you want to remove from issues or pull requests that are
            moved to the specified column(s). Separate multiple labels with
            commas. For example, <code>"help wanted, good first issue"</code>.
            For more information on labels, see “<a
              href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-labels#applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests"
              >Managing labels</a
            >.”

      <li><p>{% data reusables.actions.commit-workflow %}</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="testing-the-workflow">Testing the workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Every time a project card on a project in your repository moves, this
      workflow will run. If the card is an issue or a pull request and is moved
      into the column that you specified, then the workflow will remove the
      specified labels from the issue or a pull request. Cards that are notes
      will not be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test your workflow out by moving an issue on your project into the target
      column.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Open an issue in your repository. For more information, see “<a
          href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue"
          >Creating an issue</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Label the issue with the labels that you want the workflow to remove.
        For more information, see “<a
          href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-labels#applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests"
          >Managing labels</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the issue to the project column that you specified in your workflow
        file. For more information, see “<a
          href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board"
          >Adding issues and pull requests to a project board</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        To see the workflow run that was triggered by adding the issue to the
        project, view the history of your workflow runs. For more information,
        see “<a
          href="/actions/managing-workflow-runs/viewing-workflow-run-history"
          >Viewing workflow run history</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        When the workflow completes, the issue that you added to the project
        column should have the specified labels removed.
      </li>
