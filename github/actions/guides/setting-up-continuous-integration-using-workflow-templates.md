Anyone with write permission to a repository can set up continuous integration (CI) using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

After you set up CI, you can customize the workflow to meet your needs.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}

1. Find the template that matches the language and tooling you want to use, then click **Set up this workflow**.
   ![Setup workflow button](/assets/images/help/repository/setup-workflow-button.png)
2. Click **Start commit**.
   ![Start commit button](/assets/images/help/repository/start-commit.png)
   {% data reusables.files.write_commit_message %}
   {% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
   {% data reusables.files.propose_new_file %}

Once a push is made to your repository, you can follow the status and detailed logs of your continuous integration workflow run on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and receive customized notifications. For more information, see "[Configuring notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#github-actions-notification-options)" and "[Managing a workflow run](/articles/managing-a-workflow-run)."
