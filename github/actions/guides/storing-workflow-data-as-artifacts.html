    <h2 id="about-workflow-artifacts">About workflow artifacts</h2>
    <p>
      Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share
      that data with another job in the same workflow. An artifact is a file or
      collection of files produced during a workflow run. For example, you can
      use artifacts to save your build and test output after a workflow run has
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data reusables.github-actions.artifact-log-retention-statement %} The
      retention period for a pull request restarts each time someone pushes a
      new commit to the pull request.
    </p>
    <p>These are some of the common artifacts that you can upload:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log files and core dumps</li>
      <li>Test results, failures, and screenshots</li>
      <li>Binary or compressed files</li>
      <li>Stress test performance output and code coverage results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% ifversion fpt %}</p>
    <p>
      Storing artifacts uses storage space on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}. {% data
      reusables.github-actions.actions-billing %} For more information, see “<a
        href="/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions"
        >Managing billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% else %}</p>
    <p>
      Artifacts consume storage space on the external blob storage that is
      configured for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}.
    </p>
    <p>{% endif %}</p>
    <p>
      Artifacts are uploaded during a workflow run, and you can view an
      artifact’s name and size in the UI. When an artifact is downloaded using
      the {% data variables.product.product_name %} UI, all files that were
      individually uploaded as part of the artifact get zipped together into a
      single file. This means that billing is calculated based on the size of
      the uploaded artifact and not the size of the zip file.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} provides two actions that you
      can use to upload and download build artifacts. For more information, see
      the {% ifversion fpt %}<a
        href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact"
        >actions/upload-artifact</a
      >

      >
      actions{% else %} <code>actions/upload-artifact</code> and
      <code>download-artifact</code> actions on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}.
    </p>
    <p>To share data between jobs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Uploading files</strong>: Give the uploaded file a name and
        upload the data before the job ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Downloading files</strong>: You can only download artifacts that
        were uploaded during the same workflow run. When you download a file,
        you can reference it by name.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The steps of a job share the same environment on the runner machine, but
      run in their own individual processes. To pass data between steps in a
      job, you can use inputs and outputs. For more information about inputs and
      outputs, see “<a href="/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions"
        >Metadata syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="uploading-build-and-test-artifacts">
      Uploading build and test artifacts
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can create a continuous integration (CI) workflow to build and test
      your code. For more information about using {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} to perform CI, see “<a
        href="/articles/about-continuous-integration"
        >About continuous integration</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of building and testing your code often produces files you can
      use to debug test failures and production code that you can deploy. You
      can configure a workflow to build and test the code pushed to your
      repository and report a success or failure status. You can upload the
      build and test output to use for deployments, debugging failed tests or
      crashes, and viewing test suite coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the <code>upload-artifact</code> action to upload artifacts.
      When uploading an artifact, you can specify a single file or directory, or
      multiple files or directories. You can also exclude certain files or
      directories, and use wildcard patterns. We recommend that you provide a
      name for an artifact, but if no name is provided then
      <code>artifact</code> will be used as the default name. For more
      information on syntax, see the {% ifversion fpt %}<a
        href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact"
        >actions/upload-artifact</a

      variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}.
    </p>
    <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
    <p>
      For example, your repository or a web application might contain SASS and
      TypeScript files that you must convert to CSS and JavaScript. Assuming
      your build configuration outputs the compiled files in the
      <code>dist</code> directory, you would deploy the files in the
      <code>dist</code> directory to your web application server if all tests
      completed successfully.
    </p>
    <pre><code>|-- hello-world (repository)
|   └── dist
|   └── tests
|   └── src
|       └── sass/app.scss
|       └── app.ts
|   └── output
|       └── test
|   </code></pre>
    <p>
      This example shows you how to create a workflow for a Node.js project that
      builds the code in the <code>src</code> directory and runs the tests in
      the <code>tests</code> directory. You can assume that running
      <code>npm test</code> produces a code coverage report named
      <code>code-coverage.html</code> stored in the
      <code>output/test/</code> directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workflow uploads the production artifacts in the
      <code>dist</code> directory, but excludes any markdown files. It also and
      uploads the <code>code-coverage.html</code> report as another artifact.

      You can define a custom retention period for individual artifacts created
      by a workflow. When using a workflow to create a new artifact, you can use
      <code>retention-days</code> with the <code>upload-artifact</code> action.
      This example demonstrates how to set a custom retention period of 5 days
      for the artifact named <code>my-artifact</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="yaml{:copy}"><code>  - name: &#39;Upload Artifact&#39;

      Passing data between jobs in a workflow
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can use the <code>upload-artifact</code> and
      <code>download-artifact</code> actions to share data between jobs in a
      workflow. This example workflow illustrates how to pass data between jobs
      in the same workflow. For more information, see the {% ifversion fpt %}<a
        href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact"
        >actions/upload-artifact</a

      actions{% else %} <code>actions/upload-artifact</code> and
      <code>download-artifact</code> actions on {% data
      variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jobs that are dependent on a previous job’s artifacts must wait for the
      dependent job to complete successfully. This workflow uses the
      <code>needs</code> keyword to ensure that <code>job_1</code>,
      <code>job_2</code>, and <code>job_3</code> run sequentially. For example,
      <code>job_2</code> requires <code>job_1</code> using the
      <code>needs: job_1</code> syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Job 1 performs these steps: - Performs a math calculation and saves the
      result to a text file called <code>math-homework.txt</code>. - Uses the
      <code>upload-artifact</code> action to upload the
      <code>math-homework.txt</code> file with the artifact name
      <code>homework</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Job 2 uses the result in the previous job: - Downloads the
      <code>homework</code> artifact uploaded in the previous job. By default,
      the <code>download-artifact</code> action downloads artifacts to the
      workspace directory that the step is executing in. You can use the
      <code>path</code> input parameter to specify a different download
      directory. - Reads the value in the <code>math-homework.txt</code> file,
      performs a math calculation, and saves the result to
      <code>math-homework.txt</code> again, overwriting its contents. - Uploads
      the <code>math-homework.txt</code> file. This upload overwrites the
      previously uploaded artifact because they share the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Job 3 displays the result uploaded in the previous job: - Downloads the
      <code>homework</code> artifact. - Prints the result of the math equation
      to the log.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full math operation performed in this workflow example is
