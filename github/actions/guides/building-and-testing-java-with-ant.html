    <p>
      This guide shows you how to create a workflow that performs continuous
      integration (CI) for your Java project using the Ant build system. The
      workflow you create will allow you to see when commits to a pull request
      cause build or test failures against your default branch; this approach
      can help ensure that your code is always healthy. You can extend your CI
      workflow to upload artifacts from a workflow run.
    </p>

      {% ifversion ghae %}For instructions on how to make sure your {% data
      variables.actions.hosted_runner %} has the required software installed,

        >Creating custom images</a
      >.” {% else %} {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners
      have a tools cache with pre-installed software, which includes Java
      Development Kits (JDKs) and Ant. For a list of software and the

    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with YAML and the syntax for {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see: - “<a
        href="/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions"

      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that you have a basic understanding of Java and the Ant
      framework. For more information, see the
      <a href="https://ant.apache.org/manual/">Apache Ant Manual</a>.

      Starting with an Ant workflow template
    </h2>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provides an Ant workflow
      template that will work for most Ant-based Java projects. For more
      information, see the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/ant.yml"
        >Ant workflow template</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started quickly, you can choose the preconfigured Ant template when
      you create a new workflow. For more information, see the “<a
        href="/actions/quickstart"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} quickstart</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add this workflow manually by creating a new file in the
      <code>.github/workflows</code> directory of your repository.

    <pre class="yaml{:copy}"><code>name: Java CI

  build:

      - name: Set up JDK 11

    <p>{% endraw %}</p>
    <p>This workflow performs the following steps:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The <code>checkout</code> step downloads a copy of your repository on
        the runner.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>setup-java</code> step configures the Java 11 JDK by Adoptium.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “Build with Ant” step runs the default target in your
        <code>build.xml</code> in non-interactive mode.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The default workflow templates are excellent starting points when creating
      your build and test workflow, and you can customize the template to suit
      your project’s needs.

    <h2 id="building-and-testing-your-code">Building and testing your code</h2>
    <p>
      You can use the same commands that you use locally to build and test your
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The starter workflow will run the default target specified in your
      <em>build.xml</em> file. Your default target will commonly be set to build
      classes, run tests and package classes into their distributable format,
      for example, a JAR file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use different commands to build your project, or you want to run a
      different target, you can specify those. For example, you may want to run
      the <code>jar</code> target that’s configured in your
      <em>build-ci.xml</em> file.

      Packaging workflow data as artifacts
    </h2>
    <p>
      After your build has succeeded and your tests have passed, you may want to
      upload the resulting Java packages as a build artifact. This will store
      the built packages as part of the workflow run, and allow you to download
      them. Artifacts can help you test and debug pull requests in your local
      environment before they’re merged. For more information, see “<a
        href="/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts"
        >Persisting workflow data using artifacts</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant will usually create output files like JARs, EARs, or WARs in the
      <code>build/jar</code> directory. You can upload the contents of that
      directory using the <code>upload-artifact</code> action.
