    <p>
      This tutorial demonstrates how to use the
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues"
        ><code>actions/stale</code> action</a
      >
      to comment on and close issues that have been inactive for a certain
      period of time. For example, you can comment if an issue has been inactive
      for 30 days to prompt participants to take action. Then, if no additional
      activity occurs after 14 days, you can close the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tutorial, you will first make a workflow file that uses the
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues"
        ><code>actions/stale</code> action</a
      >. Then, you will customize the workflow to suit your needs.

        Customize the parameters in your workflow file:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>on.schedule</code> to dictate when you
            want this workflow to run. In the example above, the workflow will
            run every day at 1:30 UTC. For more information about scheduled
            workflows, see “<a

            >.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>days-before-issue-stale</code> to the
            number of days without activity before the
            <code>actions/stale</code> action labels an issue. If you never want
            this action to label issues, set this value to <code>-1</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>days-before-issue-close</code> to the
            number of days without activity before the
            <code>actions/stale</code> action closes an issue. If you never want
            this action to close issues, set this value to <code>-1</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>stale-issue-label</code> to the label
            that you want to apply to issues that have been inactive for the
            amount of time specified by <code>days-before-issue-stale</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>stale-issue-message</code> to the comment
            that you want to add to issues that are labeled by the
            <code>actions/stale</code> action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the value for <code>close-issue-message</code> to the comment
            that you want to add to issues that are closed by the
            <code>actions/stale</code> action.

    <p>
      Based on the <code>schedule</code> parameter (for example, every day at
      1:30 UTC), your workflow will find issues that have been inactive for the
      specified period of time and will add the specified comment and label.
      Additionally, your workflow will close any previously labeled issues if no
      additional activity has occurred for the specified period of time.

      You can view the history of your workflow runs to see this workflow run
      periodically. For more information, see “<a
        href="/actions/managing-workflow-runs/viewing-workflow-run-history"
        >Viewing workflow run history</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This workflow will only label and/or close 30 issues at a time in order to
      avoid rate limit abuse. You can configure this with the
      <code>operations-per-run</code> setting. For more information, see the
      <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues"
        ><code>actions/stale</code> action documentation</a
