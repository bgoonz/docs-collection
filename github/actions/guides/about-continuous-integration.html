    <p>
      Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires
      frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more
      often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer
      needs to debug when finding the source of an error. Frequent code updates
      also make it easier to merge changes from different members of a software
      development team. This is great for developers, who can spend more time
      writing code and less time debugging errors or resolving merge conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you commit code to your repository, you can continuously build and
      test the code to make sure that the commit doesn’t introduce errors. Your
      tests can include code linters (which check style formatting), security
      checks, code coverage, functional tests, and other custom checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building and testing your code requires a server. You can build and test
      updates locally before pushing code to a repository, or you can use a CI
      server that checks for new code commits in a repository.

    <p>
      {% ifversion ghae %}CI using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
      offers workflows that can build the code in your repository and run your
      tests. Workflows can run on virtual machines hosted by {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see “<a
        href="/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-ae-hosted-runners"
        >About {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s</a
      >.” {% else %} CI using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
      offers workflows that can build the code in your repository and run your
      tests. Workflows can run on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %}-hosted virtual machines, or on machines that you host yourself. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners"
        >Virtual environments for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
        %}-hosted runners</a
      >” and “<a
        href="/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners"
        >About self-hosted runners</a
      >.” {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can configure your CI workflow to run when a {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} event occurs (for example, when new code
      is pushed to your repository), on a set schedule, or when an external
      event occurs using the repository dispatch webhook.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} runs your CI tests and provides
      the results of each test in the pull request, so you can see whether the
      change in your branch introduces an error. When all CI tests in a workflow
      pass, the changes you pushed are ready to be reviewed by a team member or
      merged. When a test fails, one of your changes may have caused the
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you set up CI in your repository, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} analyzes the code in your repository and
      recommends CI workflows based on the language and framework in your
      repository. For example, if you use
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, {% data
      variables.product.product_name %} will suggest a template file that
      installs your Node.js packages and runs your tests. You can use the CI
      workflow template suggested by {% data variables.product.product_name %},
      customize the suggested template, or create your own custom workflow file
      to run your CI tests.

      In addition to helping you set up CI workflows for your project, you can
      use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to create workflows
      across the full software development life cycle. For example, you can use
      actions to deploy, package, or release your project. For more information,

      {% ifversion fpt or ghes &gt; 3.0 or ghae-next %} ## Skipping workflow
      runs
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to temporarily prevent a workflow from being triggered, you
      can add a skip instruction to the commit message. Workflows that would
      otherwise be triggered <code>on: push</code> or
      <code>on: pull_request</code>, won’t be triggered if you add any of the
      following strings to the commit message in a push, or the HEAD commit of a
      pull request:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[skip ci]</code></li>
      <li><code>[ci skip]</code></li>
      <li><code>[no ci]</code></li>
      <li><code>[skip actions]</code></li>
      <li><code>[actions skip]</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can end the commit message with two empty lines
      followed by either <code>skip-checks: true</code> or
      <code>skip-checks:true</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You won’t be able to merge the pull request if your repository is
      configured to require specific checks to pass first. To allow the pull
      request to be merged you can push a new commit to the pull request without
      the skip instruction in the commit message.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Skip instructions only apply to the
      <code>push</code> and <code>pull_request</code> events. For example,
      adding <code>[skip ci]</code> to a commit message won’t stop a workflow
      that’s triggered <code>on: pull_request_target</code> from running.
