    <p>
      You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to automate your
      project management tasks by creating workflows. Each workflow contains a
      series of tasks that are performed automatically every time the workflow
      runs. For example, you can create a workflow that runs every time an issue
      is created to add a label, leave a comment, and move the issue onto a
      project board.
    </p>
    <h2 id="when-do-workflows-run">When do workflows run?</h2>
    <p>
      You can configure your workflows to run on a schedule or be triggered when
      an event occurs. For example, you can set your workflow to run when
      someone creates an issue in a repository.
    </p>
    <p>Many workflow triggers are useful for automating project management.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An issue is opened, assigned, or labeled.</li>
      <li>A comment is added to an issue.</li>
      <li>A project card is created or moved.</li>
      <li>A scheduled time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a full list of events that can trigger workflows, see “<a
        href="/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows"
        >Events that trigger workflows</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-can-workflows-do">What can workflows do?</h2>
    <p>
      Workflows can do many things, such as commenting on an issue, adding or
      removing labels, moving cards on project boards, and opening issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can learn about using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
      for project management by following these tutorials, which include example
      workflows that you can adapt to meet your needs.
