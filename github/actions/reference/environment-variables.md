## About environment variables

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sets default environment variables that are available to every step in a workflow run. Environment variables are case-sensitive. Commands run in actions or steps can create, read, and modify environment variables.

To set custom environment variables, you need to specify the variables in the workflow file. You can define environment variables for a step, job, or entire workflow using the [`jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env`](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv), [`jobs.<job_id>.env`](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenv), and [`env`](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env) keywords. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions/#jobsjob_idstepsenv)."

```yaml
jobs:
  weekday_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      DAY_OF_WEEK: Mon
    steps:
      - name: "Hello world when it's Monday"
        if: ${{ env.DAY_OF_WEEK == 'Mon' }}
        run: echo "Hello $FIRST_NAME $middle_name $Last_Name, today is Monday!"
        env:
          FIRST_NAME: Mona
          middle_name: The
          Last_Name: Octocat
```

{% endraw %}

To use the value of an environment variable in a workflow file, you should use the [`env` context](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#env-context). If you want to use the value of an environment variable inside a runner, you can use the runner operating system's normal method for reading environment variables.

If you use the workflow file's `run` key to read environment variables from within the runner operating system (as shown in the example above), the variable is substituted in the runner operating system after the job is sent to the runner. For other parts of a workflow file, you must use the `env` context to read environment variables; this is because workflow keys (such as `if`) require the variable to be substituted during workflow processing before it is sent to the runner.

You can also use the {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 2.22 or ghae %}`GITHUB_ENV` environment file{% else %} `set-env` workflow command{% endif %} to set an environment variable that the following steps in a job can use. The {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 2.22 or ghae %}environment file{% else %} `set-env` command{% endif %} can be used directly by an action or as a shell command in a workflow file using the `run` keyword. For more information, see "[Workflow commands for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions/#setting-an-environment-variable)."

## Default environment variables

We strongly recommend that actions use environment variables to access the filesystem rather than using hardcoded file paths. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sets environment variables for actions to use in all runner environments.

### Determining when to use default environment variables or contexts

{% data reusables.github-actions.using-context-or-environment-variables %}

## Naming conventions for environment variables

When you set a custom environment variable, you cannot use any of the default environment variable names listed above with the prefix `GITHUB_`. If you attempt to override the value of one of these default environment variables, the assignment is ignored.

Any new environment variables you set that point to a location on the filesystem should have a `_PATH` suffix. The `HOME` and `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` default variables are exceptions to this convention because the words "home" and "workspace" already imply a location.
