    <h2 id="about-environments">About environments</h2>
    <p>
      You can configure environments with protection rules and secrets. When a
      workflow job references an environment, the job won’t start until all of
      the environment’s protection rules pass. A job also cannot access secrets
      that are defined in an environment until all the environment protection
      rules pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt %} Environment protection rules and environment secrets
      are only available on public repositories and private repositories on an
      enterprise plan. If you convert a repository from public to private on a
      non-enterprise plan, any configured protection rules or environment
      secrets will be ignored, and you will not be able to configure any
      environments. If you convert your repository back to public, you will have
      access to any previously configured protection rules and environment
      secrets. {% endif %}
    </p>
    <h3 id="environment-protection-rules">Environment protection rules</h3>
    <p>
      Environment protection rules require specific conditions to pass before a
      job referencing the environment can proceed. {% ifversion fpt or ghae-next
      or ghes &gt; 3.1 %}You can use environment protection rules to require a
      manual approval, delay a job, or restrict the environment to certain
      branches.{% else %}You can use environment protection rules to require a
      manual approval or delay a job.{% endif %}
    </p>
    <h4 id="required-reviewers">Required reviewers</h4>
    <p>
      Use required reviewers to require a specific person or team to approve
      workflow jobs that reference the environment. You can list up to six users
      or teams as reviewers. The reviewers must have at least read access to the
      repository. Only one of the required reviewers needs to approve the job
      for it to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on reviewing jobs that reference an environment with
      required reviewers, see “<a
        href="/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments"
        >Reviewing deployments</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h4 id="wait-timer">Wait timer</h4>
    <p>
      Use a wait timer to delay a job for a specific amount of time after the
      job is initially triggered. The time (in minutes) must be an integer
      between 0 and 43,200 (30 days).
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt or ghae-next or ghes &gt; 3.1 %} #### Deployment branches
    </p>
    <p>
      Use deployment branches to restrict which branches can deploy to the
      environment. Below are the options for deployment branches for an
      environment:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>All branches</strong>: All branches in the repository can deploy
        to the environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protected branches</strong>: Only branches with branch
        protection rules enabled can deploy to the environment. If no branch
        protection rules are defined for any branch in the repository, then all
        branches can deploy. For more information about branch protection rules,
        see “<a
          href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches"
          >About protected branches</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Selected branches</strong>: Only branches that match your
          specified name patterns can deploy to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you specify <code>releases/*</code> as a deployment
          branch rule, only branches whose name begins with
          <code>releases/</code> can deploy to the environment. (Wildcard
          characters will not match <code>/</code>. To match branches that begin
          with <code>release/</code> and contain an additional single slash, use
          <code>release/*/*</code>.) If you add <code>main</code> as a
          deployment branch rule, a branch named <code>main</code> can also
          deploy to the environment. For more information about syntax options
          for deployment branches, see the
          <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch"
            >Ruby File.fnmatch documentation</a
          >. {% endif %} ### Environment secrets
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Secrets stored in an environment are only available to workflow jobs that
      reference the environment. If the environment requires approval, a job
      cannot access environment secrets until one of the required reviewers
      approves it. For more information about secrets, see “<a
        href="/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets"
        >Encrypted secrets</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Workflows that run on self-hosted runners are not
      run in an isolated container, even if they use environments. Environment
      secrets should be treated with the same level as security as repository
      and organization secrets. For more information, see “<a
        href="/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners"
        >Security hardening for GitHub Actions</a

      must be unique within the repository. 1. Configure any environment

    <p>
      Running a workflow that references an environment that does not exist will
      create an environment with the referenced name. The newly created
      environment will not have any protection rules or secrets configured.
      Anyone that can edit workflows in the repository can create environments
      via a workflow file, but only repository admins can configure the
      environment.
    </p>
    <h2 id="referencing-an-environment">Referencing an environment</h2>
    <p>
      Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment. Any protection
      rules configured for the environment must pass before a job referencing
      the environment is sent to a runner. When the job is sent to the runner,
      the job can access the environment’s secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on syntax to reference environments in workflows, see
      “<a
        href="/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenvironment"
        >Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions</a

      with required reviewers, see “<a
        href="/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments"
        >Reviewing deployments</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When a workflow references an environment, the environment will appear in
      the repository’s deployments. For more information about viewing current
      and previous deployments, see “<a

        >Viewing deployment history</a
