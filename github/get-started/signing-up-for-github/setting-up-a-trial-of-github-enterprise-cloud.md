## Finishing your trial

You can buy {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} or downgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} at any time during your trial.

If you don't purchase {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} before your trial ends, your organization will be downgraded to {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} and lose access to any advanced tooling and features that are only included with paid products, including {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites published from those private repositories. If you don't plan to upgrade, to avoid losing access to advanced features, make the repositories public before your trial ends. For more information, see "[Setting repository visibility](/articles/setting-repository-visibility)."

Downgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for organizations also disables any SAML settings configured during the trial period. Once you purchase {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, your SAML settings will be enabled again for users in your organization to authenticate.
