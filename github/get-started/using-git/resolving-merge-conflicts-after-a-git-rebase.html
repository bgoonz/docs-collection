<h1 class="title">Resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase</h1>
</header>
<p>After you reorder and manipulate commits using <code>git rebase</code>, should a merge conflict occur, Git will tell you so with the following message printed to the terminal:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>error: could not apply fa39187... something to add to patch A

When you have resolved this problem, run &quot;git rebase --continue&quot;.
If you prefer to skip this patch, run &quot;git rebase --skip&quot; instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run &quot;git rebase --abort&quot;.
Could not apply fa39187f3c3dfd2ab5faa38ac01cf3de7ce2e841... Change fake file</code></pre>
<p>Here, Git is telling you which commit is causing the conflict (<code>fa39187</code>). You’re given three choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run <code>git rebase --abort</code> to completely undo the rebase. Git will return you to your branch’s state as it was before <code>git rebase</code> was called.</li>
<li>You can run <code>git rebase --skip</code> to completely skip the commit. That means that none of the changes introduced by the problematic commit will be included. It is very rare that you would choose this option.</li>
<li>You can fix the conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix the conflict, you can follow <a href="/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line">the standard procedures for resolving merge conflicts from the command line</a>. When you’re finished, you’ll need to call <code>git rebase --continue</code> in order for Git to continue processing the rest of the rebase.</p>
