    <h2 id="how-can-i-create-a-github-free-or-github-team-organization">
      How can I create a GitHub Free or GitHub Team organization?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have a GitHub account, create a new organization on our
      <a href="https://github.com/organizations/plan">team plan page</a>. If you
      don’t have a GitHub account, you can
      <a href="https://github.com/">create one on our homepage</a> and you’ll be
      prompted to create an organization during the sign-up process.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-compare-which-features-are-in-each-plan">
      How can I compare which features are in each plan?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can see pricing and a full list of features for each product at &lt;{%
      data variables.product.pricing_url %}&gt;.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-long-will-github-free-allow-unlimited-collaborators">
      How long will GitHub Free allow unlimited collaborators?

    <p>Forever! This change is permanent.</p>
    <h2
      id="i-already-paid-for-the-yearly-pro-or-team-plan-do-i-get-a-refund-for-the-price-difference"
    >
      I already paid for the yearly Pro or Team plan, do I get a refund for the
      price difference?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Customers who are currently paying annually for Pro and Team plans and
      signed up before April 14 will receive a refund for a prorated amount
      through the end of their annual billing term. For example, if you are two
      months into your subscription that is billed annually, you will receive a
      refund for the price difference for the remaining ten months. These
      refunds will be processed in approximately 30 days. Once your refund is
      processed, a notification will be sent to the billing email.

    <h2

    >
      What is the difference between GitHub Free for individual developers and
      GitHub Free for organizations?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For details on the differences for each GitHub Free product, see “<a
        href="/articles/github-s-products"
        >{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}’s products</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2
      id="how-can-i-get-more-actions-minutes-if-i-need-more-than-allocated-in-the-github-team-plan"
    >
      How can I get more Actions minutes if I need more than allocated in the
      GitHub Team plan?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most small teams use fewer than 3,000 Actions minutes/month, but some
      teams might use more. If your team needs additional minutes for private
      repositories, you can increase your spending limit for GitHub Actions.
      Actions minutes and Packages storage are still free for your public
      repositories. For more information, see “<a
        href="/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/managing-your-spending-limit-for-github-actions"
        >Managing your spending limit for GitHub Actions</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-the-seat-limit-changes-affect-me">
      How do the seat limit changes affect me?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} has no minimum seat
      requirement, if you are using fewer than five seats in your organization,
      you can remove paid seats to reduce your bill. For more information, see
      “<a
        href="/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-github-subscription#removing-paid-seats-from-your-organization"
        >Downgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}
        subscription</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2
      id="is-anything-changing-for-teams-on-the-github-team-for-open-source-plan"
    >
      Is anything changing for teams on the GitHub Team for Open Source plan?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If your organization account currently uses the GitHub Team for Open
      Source plan, you’ve been automatically moved to GitHub Free, which
      includes private repositories with unlimited collaborators, 2,000 Actions
      minutes for private repositories, and GitHub Community Support. Actions
      minutes and Packages storage are still free for your public repositories.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-github-community-support">
      What is GitHub Community Support?
    </h2>
    <p>
      GitHub Community Support includes support through our
      <a href="https://github.community/">Community Forum</a>, where you can
      browse solutions from the GitHub community, ask new questions, and share
      ideas. GitHub Community Support is staffed by Support Engineers on the
      GitHub Team, who moderate the Community Forum along with our most active
      community members. If you need to report spam, report abuse, or have
      issues with account access, you can send a message to our Support Team on
      https://support.github.com/.

    <h2 id="how-does-this-change-affect-education-benefits">
      How does this change affect education benefits?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Students and teachers will continue to receive all of the benefits they
      get today. GitHub will continue to offer GitHub Pro as part of its
      <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a>
      benefits to all students. Additionally, teachers will continue to have
      access to GitHub Team as part of the
      <a href="https://education.github.com/toolbox">Teacher Toolbox</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-does-this-affect-me-if-i-currently-pay-by-invoice">
      How does this affect me if I currently pay by invoice?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’re currently an invoice customer, email your sales representative
      for additional details. If you’re not sure who your sales representative
      is, contact your billing manager or account owner.
    </p>
    <h2
      id="how-will-this-impact-users-and-organizations-in-regions-where-u.s.-government-sanctions-are-applied"
    >
      How will this impact users and organizations in regions where U.S.
      government sanctions are applied?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Due to U.S. trade controls law restrictions, GitHub is unable to provide
      private repository services and paid services to accounts in U.S.
      sanctioned regions. GitHub has preserved, however, access to free public
      repository services. Please read about
      <a href="/github/site-policy/github-and-trade-controls"
        >GitHub and Trade Controls</a
      >
      for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub will continue advocating with U.S. regulators for the greatest
      possible access to free code collaboration services to developers in
      sanctioned regions, including free private repositories. We believe that
      offering those free services supports U.S. foreign policy of encouraging
      the free flow of information and free speech in those regions.
