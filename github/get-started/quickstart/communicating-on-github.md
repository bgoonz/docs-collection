## Introduction

{% data variables.product.product_name %} provides built-in collaborative communication tools allowing you to interact closely with your community. This quickstart guide will show you how to pick the right tool for your needs.

{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
You can create and participate in issues, pull requests and team discussions, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.
{% endif %}

### {% data variables.product.prodname_github_issues %}
- are useful for discussing specific details of a project such as bug reports, planned improvements and feedback. 
- are specific to a repository, and usually have a clear owner. 
- are often referred to as {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s bug-tracking system.
  
### Pull requests
- allow you to propose specific changes.
- allow you comment directly on proposed changes suggested by others. 
- are specific to a repository. 
 
{% ifversion fpt %}
### {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}
-  are like a forum, and are best used for open-form ideas and discussions where collaboration is important. 
-  may span many repositories. 
-  provide a collaborative experience outside the codebase, allowing the brainstorming of ideas, and the creation of a community knowledge base.
-  often don’t have a clear owner.
-  often do not result in an actionable task.
{% endif %}

### Team discussions
- can be started on your team's page for conversations that span across projects and don't belong in a specific issue or pull request. Instead of opening an issue in a repository to discuss an idea, you can include the entire team by having a conversation in a team discussion.
- allow you to hold discussions with your team about planning, analysis, design, user research and general project decision making in one place.{% ifversion ghes or ghae %} 
- provide a collaborative experience outside the codebase, allowing the brainstorming of ideas.
- often don’t have a clear owner.
