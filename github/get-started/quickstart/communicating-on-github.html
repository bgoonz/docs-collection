      These examples showed you how to decide which is the best tool for your
      conversations on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. But this is
      only the beginning; there is so much more you can do to tailor these tools
      to your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For issues, for example, you can tag issues with labels for quicker
      searching and create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful
      issues. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues#working-with-issues"
        >About issues</a
      >” and “<a

        >About issue and pull request templates</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For pull requests, you can create draft pull requests if your proposed
      changes are still a work in progress. Draft pull requests cannot be merged
      until they’re marked as ready for review. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests"
        >About pull requests</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt %} For {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %},
      you can set up a code of conduct and pin discussions that contain
      important information for your community. For more information, see “<a

        >About discussions</a
      >.” {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      For team discussions, you can edit or delete discussions on a team’s page,
      and you can configure notifications for team discussions. For more
      information, see “<a
