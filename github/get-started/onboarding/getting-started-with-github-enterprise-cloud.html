      This guide will walk you through setting up, configuring and managing your
      {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} account as an organization
      or enterprise owner.
    </p>
    <h2 id="part-1-choosing-your-account-type">
      Part 1: Choosing your account type
    </h2>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provides two types of
      Enterprise products:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}</strong></li>
      <li><strong>{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The main difference between the products is that {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} is hosted by {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, while {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} is self-hosted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} product, there
      are two different types of account that you can use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A single organization account</li>
      <li>An enterprise account that contains multiple organizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In either scenario, your users will use their own self-created user
      account and you’ll invite them to join. ### 1. Understanding the
      differences between an organization account and enterprise account
    </p>
    <p>
      Both organization and enterprise accounts are available with {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. An organization is a shared
      account where groups of people can collaborate across many projects at
      once, and owners and administrators can manage access to data and
      projects. An enterprise account enables collaboration between multiple
      organizations, and allows owners to centrally manage policy, billing and
      security for these organizations. For more information on the differences,
      see “<a
        href="/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations#organizations-and-enterprise-accounts"
        >Organizations and enterprise accounts</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose an enterprise account, keep in mind that some policies can
      be set only at an organization level, while others can be enforced for all
      organizations in an enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you choose the account type you would like, you can proceed to
      setting up your account. In each of the sections in this guide, proceed to
      either the single organization or enterprise account section based on your
      account type.
    </p>
    <h2 id="part-2-setting-up-your-account">Part 2: Setting up your account</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you
      will want to create your organization or enterprise account and set up and
      view billing settings, subscriptions and usage. ### Setting up a single
      organization account with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}
    </p>
    <h4 id="about-organizations">1. About organizations</h4>
    <p>
      Organizations are shared accounts where groups of people can collaborate
      across many projects at once. With {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, owners and administrators can
      manage their organization with sophisticated user authentication and
      management, as well as escalated support and security options. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations"
        >About organizations</a
      >.” #### 2. Creating or upgrading an organization account
    </p>
    <p>
      To use an organization account with {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you will first need to create an
      organization. When prompted to choose a plan, select “Enterprise”. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch"
        >Creating a new organization from scratch</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you have an existing organization account that you would
      like to upgrade, follow the steps in “<a
        href="/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/upgrading-your-github-subscription#upgrading-your-organizations-subscription"
        >Upgrading your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}
        subscription</a
      >.” #### 3. Setting up and managing billing
    </p>
    <p>
      When you choose to use an organization account with {% data
      variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you’ll first have access to a
      <a
        href="/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud"
        >14-day trial</a
      >. If you don’t purchase {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}
      or {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} before your trial ends, your
      organization will be downgraded to {% data
      variables.product.prodname_free_user %} and lose access to any advanced
      tooling and features that are only included with paid products. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud#finishing-your-trial"
        >Finishing your trial</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Your organization’s billing settings page allows you to manage settings
      like your payment method and billing cycle, view information about your
      subscription, and upgrade your storage and {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} minutes. For more information on
      managing your billing settings, see “<a
        href="/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings"
        >Managing your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} billing
        settings</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Only organization members with the <em>owner</em> or
      <em>billing manager</em> role can access or change billing settings for
      your organization. A billing manager is a user who manages the billing
      settings for your organization and does not use a paid license in your
      organization’s subscription. For more information on adding a billing
      manager to your organization, see “<a
        href="/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization"

    <h4 id="about-enterprise-accounts">1. About enterprise accounts</h4>
    <p>
      An enterprise account allows you to centrally manage policy and settings
      for multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organizations,
      including member access, billing and usage and security. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-your-enterprise-account/about-enterprise-accounts"
        >About enterprise accounts</a
      >.” #### 2. Adding organizations to your enterprise account
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create new organizations to manage within your enterprise account.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise-account"

      Contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sales account
      representative if you want to transfer an existing organization to your
      enterprise account. #### 3. Viewing the subscription and usage for your
      enterprise account You can view your current subscription, license usage,
      invoices, payment history, and other billing information for your
      enterprise account at any time. Both enterprise owners and billing
      managers can access and manage billing settings for enterprise accounts.

      Managing members of an enterprise account
    </h3>
    <p>
      Managing members of an enterprise is separate from managing members or
      teams in an organization. It is important to note that enterprise owners
      or administrators cannot access organization-level settings or manage
      members for organizations in their enterprise unless they are made an
      organization owner. For more information, see the above section, “<a
        href="#managing-members-and-teams-in-your-organization"
        >Managing members and teams in your organization</a
      >.” #### 1. Assigning roles in an enterprise By default, everyone in an
      enterprise is a member of the enterprise. There are also administrative
      roles, including enterprise owner and billing manager, that have different
      levels of access to enterprise settings and data. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise"
        >Roles in an enterprise</a
      >.” #### 2. Inviting people to manage your enterprise You can invite
      people to manage your enterprise as enterprise owners or billing managers,
      as well as remove those who no longer need access. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/inviting-people-to-manage-your-enterprise"
        >Inviting people to manage your enterprise</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also grant enterprise members the ability to manage support
      tickets in the support portal. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-support-entitlements-for-your-enterprise"
        >Managing support entitlements for your enterprise</a
      >.” #### 3. Viewing people in your enterprise To audit access to
      enterprise-owned resources or user license usage, you can view every
      enterprise administrator, enterprise member, and outside collaborator in
      your enterprise. You can see the organizations that a member belongs to
      and the specific repositories that an outside collaborator has access to.
      For more information, see “<a

    <p>
      You can help keep your organization secure by requiring two-factor
      authentication, configuring security features, reviewing your
      organization’s audit log and integrations, and enabling SAML single
      sign-on and team synchronization. #### 1. Requiring two-factor

      {% data reusables.getting-started.reviewing-org-audit-log-and-integrations
      %} #### 4. Enabling and enforcing SAML single sign-on for your
      organization If you manage your applications and the identities of your
      organization members with an identity provider (IdP), you can configure
      SAML single-sign-on (SSO) to control and secure access to organization
      resources like repositories, issues and pull requests. When members of
      your organization access organization resources that use SAML SSO, {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will redirect them to your IdP to
      authenticate. For more information, see “<a

        >About identity and access management with SAML single sign-on</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Organization owners can choose to disable, enable but not enforce, or
      enable and enforce SAML SSO. For more information, see “<a

      >.” #### 5. Managing team synchronization for your organization
      Organization owners can enable team synchronization between your identity
      provider (IdP) and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to allow
      organization owners and team maintainers to connect teams in your
      organization with IdP groups. For more information, see “<a

    <p>
      To manage security for your enterprise, you can require two-factor
      authentication, manage allowed IP addresses, enable SAML single sign-on
      and team synchronization at an enterprise level, and sign up for and
      enforce GitHub Advanced Security features. #### 1. Requiring two-factor
      authentication and managing allowed IP addresses for organizations in your
      enterprise account Enterprise owners can require that organization
      members, billing managers, and outside collaborators in all organizations
      owned by an enterprise account use two-factor authentication to secure
      their personal accounts. Before doing so, we recommend notifying all who
      have access to organizations in your enterprise. You can also configure an
      allow list for specific IP addresses to restrict access to assets owned by
      organizations in your enterprise account.
    </p>
    <p>

      in your enterprise account You can centrally manage access to your
      enterprise’s resources, organization membership and team membership using
      your IdP and SAM single sign-on (SSO). Enterprise owners can enable SAML
      SSO across all organizations owned by an enterprise account. For more
