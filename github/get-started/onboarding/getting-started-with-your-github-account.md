For more information, see "[About two-factor authentication](/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)."
{% endif %}
### {% ifversion fpt %}5.{% elsif ghes %}3.{% else %}2.{% endif %} Viewing your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile and contribution graph
Your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile tells people the story of your work through the repositories and gists you've pinned, the organization memberships you've chosen to publicize, the contributions you've made, and the projects you've created. For more information, see "[About your profile](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile)" and "[Viewing contributions on your profile](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile)."

## Part 2: Using {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s tools and processes
To best use {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you'll need to set up Git. Git is responsible for everything {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-related that happens locally on your computer. To effectively collaborate on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you'll write in issues and pull requests using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Flavored Markdown.

### 1. Learning Git
{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for other people to view, fetch, and update using Git. For more information about Git, see the "[Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)" guide. For more information about how Git is used on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} flow](/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)."
### 2. Setting up Git
If you plan to use Git locally on your computer, whether through the command line, an IDE or text editor, you will need to install and set up Git. For more information, see "[Set up Git](/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)."

If you prefer to use a visual interface, you can download and use {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} comes packaged with Git, so there is no need to install Git separately. For more information, see "[Getting started with {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}](/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)."

Once you install Git, you can connect to {% data variables.product.product_name %} repositories from your local computer, whether your own repository or another user's fork. When you connect to a {% data variables.product.product_name %} repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with {% data variables.product.product_name %} using either HTTPS or SSH. For more information, see "[About remote repositories](/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)."

### 3. Choosing how to interact with {% data variables.product.product_name %}
Everyone has their own unique workflow for interacting with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}; the interfaces and methods you use depend on your preference and what works best for your needs.

For more information about how to authenticate to {% data variables.product.product_name %} with each of these methods, see "[About authentication to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github)."

| **Method**  | **Description** | **Use cases** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Browse to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} | If you don't need to work with files locally, {% data variables.product.product_name %} lets you complete most Git-related actions directly in the browser, from creating and forking repositories to editing files and opening pull requests.| This method is useful if you want a visual interface and need to do quick, simple changes that don't require working locally. |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} | {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} extends and simplifies your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} workflow, using a visual interface instead of text commands on the command line. For more information on getting started with {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}, see "[Getting started with {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}](/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)." | This method is best if you need or want to work with files locally, but prefer using a visual interface to use Git and interact with {% data variables.product.product_name %}. |
| IDE or text editor  | You can set a default text editor, like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open and edit your files with Git, use extensions, and view the project structure. For more information, see "[Associating text editors with Git](/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git)." | This is convenient if you are working with more complex files and projects and want everything in one place, since text editors or IDEs often allow you to directly access the command line in the editor. |
| Command line, with or without {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} | For the most granular control and customization of how you use Git and interact with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can use the command line. For more information on using Git commands, see "[Git cheatsheet](/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/git-cheatsheet)."<br/><br/> {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} is a separate command-line tool you can install that brings pull requests, issues, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, and other {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} features to your terminal, so you can do all your work in one place. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}](/github/getting-started-with-github/using-github/github-cli)." | This is most convenient if you are already working from the command line, allowing you to avoid switching context, or if you are more comfortable using the command line. |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} API | {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has a REST API and GraphQL API that you can use to interact with {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[Getting started with the API](/github/extending-github/getting-started-with-the-api)." | The {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} API would be most helpful if you wanted to automate common tasks, back up your data, or create integrations that extend {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. |

## Part 3: Collaborating on {% data variables.product.product_name %}
Any number of people can work together in repositories across {% data variables.product.product_name %}. You can configure settings, create project boards, and manage your notifications to encourage effective collaboration.

### 1. Working with repositories

#### Creating a repository
A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have any number of public and private repositories in your user account. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, as well as the revision history for all files in the repository. For more information, see "[About repositories](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories)."

When you create a new repository, you should initialize the repository with a README file to let people know about your project. For more information, see "[Creating a new repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-new-repository)."

#### Cloning a repository
You can clone an existing repository from {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your local computer, making it easier to add or remove files, fix merge conflicts, or make complex commits. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. For more information, see "[Cloning a repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)."

#### Forking a repository
A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage, where any changes you make will not affect the original repository unless you submit a pull request to the project owner. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. For more information, see "[Working with forks](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)."
### 2. Importing your projects
If you have existing projects you'd like to move over to {% data variables.product.product_name %} you can import projects using the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Importer, the command line, or external migration tools. For more information, see "[Importing source code to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github)."

### 3. Managing collaborators and permissions
You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and project boards. You can invite other people to your repository as collaborators from the **Collaborators** tab in the repository settings. For more information, see "[Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)."

You are the owner of any repository you create in your user account and have full control of the repository. Collaborators have write access to your repository, limiting what they have permission to do. For more information, see "[Permission levels for a user account repository](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository)."

### 4. Managing repository settings
As the owner of a repository you can configure several settings, including the repository's visibility, topics, and social media preview. For more information, see "[Managing repository settings](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings)."

### 5. Setting up your project for healthy contributions
{% ifversion fpt %}
To encourage collaborators in your repository, you need a community that encourages people to use, contribute to, and evangelize your project. For more information, see "[Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)" in the Open Source Guides.

By adding files like contributing guidelines, a code of conduct, and a license to your repository you can create an environment where it's easier for collaborators to make meaningful, useful contributions. For more information, see "[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions)."
{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}

For more information, see "[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions)."
{% endif %}

### 6. Using GitHub Issues and project boards
You can use GitHub Issues to organize your work with issues and pull requests and manage your workflow with project boards. For more information, see "[About issues](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)" and "[About project boards](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)."

### 7. Managing notifications
Notifications provide updates about the activity on {% data variables.product.product_name %} you've subscribed to or participated in. If you're no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe, unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you'll receive in the future. For more information, see "[About notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/about-notifications)."

### 8. Working with {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}

## Part 5: Building securely on {% data variables.product.product_name %}
{% data variables.product.product_name %} has a variety of security features that help keep code and secrets secure in repositories. Some features are available for all repositories, while others are only available for public repositories and repositories with a {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} license. For an overview of {% data variables.product.product_name %} security features, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} security features](/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features)."

### 1. Securing your repository
As a repository administrator, you can secure your repositories by configuring repository security settings. These include managing access to your repository, setting a security policy, and managing dependencies. For public repositories, and for private repositories owned by organizations where {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is enabled, you can also configure code and secret scanning to automatically identify vulnerabilities and ensure tokens and keys are not exposed. 

For more information on steps you can take to secure your repositories, see "[Securing your repository](/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
### 2. Managing your dependencies
A large part of building securely is maintaining your project's dependencies to ensure that all packages and applications you depend on are updated and secure. You can manage your repository's dependencies on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by exploring the dependency graph for your repository, using Dependabot to automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date, and receiving Dependabot alerts and security updates for vulnerable dependencies. 

For more information, see "[Securing your software supply chain](/code-security/supply-chain-security)."
