Using an HTTPS remote URL has some advantages compared with using SSH. It's easier to set up than SSH, and usually works through strict firewalls and proxies. However, it also prompts you to enter your {% data variables.product.product_name %} credentials every time you pull or push a repository. 

{% data reusables.user_settings.password-authentication-deprecation %}

You can avoid being prompted for your password by configuring Git to [cache your credentials](/github/getting-started-with-github/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) for you. Once you've configured credential caching, Git automatically uses your cached personal access token when you pull or push a repository using HTTPS.
