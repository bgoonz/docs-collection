## Updating your credentials via Keychain Access

1. Click on the Spotlight icon (magnifying glass) on the right side of the menu bar. Type `Keychain access` then press the Enter key to launch the app.

2. In Keychain Access, search for **{% data variables.command_line.backticks %}**.
3. Find the "internet password" entry for `{% data variables.command_line.backticks %}`.
4. Edit or delete the entry accordingly.

## Deleting your credentials via the command line

Through the command line, you can use the credential helper directly to erase the keychain entry.

```shell
$ git credential-osxkeychain erase
host={% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}
protocol=https
> <em>[Press Return]</em>
```

If it's successful, nothing will print out. To test that it works, try and clone a private repository from {% data variables.product.product_location %}. If you are prompted for a password, the keychain entry was deleted.
