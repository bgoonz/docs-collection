## Configuring ignored files for a single repository

You can create a _.gitignore_ file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit.
To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the _.gitignore_ file in to your repository.

GitHub maintains an official list of recommended _.gitignore_ files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the `github/gitignore` public repository. You can also use gitignore.io to create a _.gitignore_ file for your operating system, programming language, or IDE. For more information, see "[github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)" and the "[gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)" site.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %} 2. Navigate to the location of your Git repository. 3. Create a _.gitignore_ file for your repository.

```shell
$ touch .gitignore
```

For an example _.gitignore_ file, see "[Some common .gitignore configurations](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657)" in the Octocat repository.

If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.

```shell
$ git rm --cached <em>FILENAME</em>
```

## Configuring ignored files for all repositories on your computer

You can also create a global _.gitignore_ file to define a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer. For example, you might create the file at _~/.gitignore_global_ and add some rules to it.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %} 2. Configure Git to use the exclude file _~/.gitignore_global_ for all Git repositories.

```shell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

## Excluding local files without creating a _.gitignore_ file

If you don't want to create a _.gitignore_ file to share with others, you can create rules that are not committed with the repository. You can use this technique for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor.

Use your favorite text editor to open the file called _.git/info/exclude_ within the root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %} 2. Navigate to the location of your Git repository. 3. Using your favorite text editor, open the file _.git/info/exclude_.
