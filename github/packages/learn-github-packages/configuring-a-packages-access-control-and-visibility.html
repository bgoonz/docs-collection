</header>
<p>Packages with granular permissions are scoped to a personal user or organization account. You can change the access control and visibility of a package separately from the repository that it is connected (or linked) to.</p>
<p>Currently, you can only use granular permissions with the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}. Granular permissions are not supported in our other package registries, such as the npm registry.</p>
<p>For more information about permissions for repository-scoped packages, packages-related scopes for PATs, or managing permissions for your actions workflows, see “<a href="/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages">About permissions for GitHub Packages</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="configuring-access-to-container-images-for-your-personal-account">Configuring access to container images for your personal account</h2>
<p>If you have admin permissions to a container image that’s owned by a user account, you can assign read, write, or admin roles to other users. For more information about these permission roles, see “<a href="#visibility-and-access-permissions-for-container-images">Visibility and access permissions for container images</a>.”</p>
<p>If your package is private or internal and owned by an organization, then you can only give access to other organization members or teams.</p>

<h2 id="inheriting-access-for-a-container-image-from-a-repository">Inheriting access for a container image from a repository</h2>
<p>To simplify package management through {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows, you can enable a container image to inherit the access permissions of a repository by default.</p>
<p>If you inherit the access permissions of the repository where your package’s workflows are stored, then you can adjust access to your package through the repository’s permissions.</p>
<p>Once a repository is synced, you can’t access the package’s granular access settings. To customize the package’s permissions through the granular package access settings, you must remove the synced repository first.</p>
<p>{% data reusables.package_registry.package-settings-from-org-level %} 2. Under “Repository source”, select <strong>Inherit access from repository (recommended)</strong>. <img src="/assets/images/help/package-registry/inherit-repo-access-for-package.png" alt="Inherit repo access checkbox" /></p>
<h2 id="ensuring-workflow-access-to-your-package">Ensuring workflow access to your package</h2>
<p>To ensure that a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow has access to your package, you must give explicit access to the repository where the workflow is stored.</p>
<p>The specified repository does not need to be the repository where the source code for the package is kept. You can give multiple repositories workflow access to a package.</p>
<p>{% note %}</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Syncing your container image with a repository through the <strong>Actions access</strong> menu option is different than connecting your container to a repository. For more information about linking a repository to your container, see “<a href="/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package">Connecting a repository to a package</a>.”</p>
