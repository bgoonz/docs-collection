    <p>
      On {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} if you have the required
      access, you can delete: - an entire private package - an entire public
      package, if there’s not more than 25 downloads of any version of the
      package - a specific version of a private package - a specific version of
      a public package, if the package version doesn’t have more than 25
      downloads
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> - You cannot delete a public package if any version
      of the package has more than 25 downloads. In this scenario, contact
      <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub support</a> for
      further assistance. - When deleting public packages, be aware that you may
      break projects that depend on your package.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      On {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can also restore an
      entire package or package version, if: - You restore the package within 30
      days of its deletion. - The same package namespace is still available and
      not used for a new package.
    </p>
    <h2 id="packages-api-support">Packages API support</h2>

      You can use the REST API to manage your packages. For more information,

      For packages that inherit their permissions and access from repositories,
      you can use GraphQL to delete a specific package version.{% ifversion fpt

      support containers or Docker images that use the package namespace
      <code>https://ghcr.io/OWNER/PACKAGE-NAME</code>. For more information

    </p>
    <p>
      Repository-scoped packages on {% data variables.product.prodname_registry

    <p>
      To delete a package that has granular permissions separate from a
      repository, such as container images stored at

      access to the package.

      Deleting a version of a repository-scoped package with GraphQL

      For packages that inherit their permissions and access from repositories,

    </p>
    <p>
      {% ifversion fpt %} GraphQL is not supported for containers or Docker

    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <code>deletePackageVersion</code> mutation in the GraphQL API. You
      must use a token with the <code>read:packages</code>,
      <code>delete:packages</code>, and <code>repo</code> scopes. For more
      information about tokens, see “<a
        href="/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages"
        >About {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example demonstrates how to delete a package version, using
      a <code>packageVersionId</code> of
      <code>MDIyOlJlZ2lzdHJ5UGFja2FnZVZlcnNpb243MTExNg</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>curl -X POST \
-H &quot;Accept: application/vnd.github.package-deletes-preview+json&quot; \
-H &quot;Authorization: bearer TOKEN&quot; \
-d &#39;{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;mutation { deletePackageVersion(input:{packageVersionId:\&quot;MDIyOlJlZ2lzdHJ5UGFja2FnZVZlcnNpb243MTExNg==\&quot;}) { success }}&quot;}&#39; \
HOSTNAME/graphql</code></pre>
    <p>
      To find all of the private packages you have published to {% data
      variables.product.prodname_registry %}, along with the version IDs for the
      packages, you can use the <code>packages</code> connection through the
      <code>repository</code> object. You will need a token with the
      <code>read:packages</code> and <code>repo</code> scopes. For more
      information, see the
      <a href="/graphql/reference/objects#repository"><code>packages</code></a>
      connection or the
      <a href="/graphql/reference/interfaces#packageowner"
        ><code>PackageOwner</code></a
      >
      interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about the <code>deletePackageVersion</code> mutation,
      see “<a href="/graphql/reference/mutations#deletepackageversion"
        ><code>deletePackageVersion</code></a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot directly delete an entire package using GraphQL, but if you
      delete every version of a package, the package will no longer show on {%
      data variables.product.product_name %}.

      You can restore a deleted package or version if: - You restore the package
      within 30 days of its deletion. - The same package namespace and version
      is still available and not reused for a new package.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you have a deleted rubygem package named
      <code>octo-package</code> that was scoped to the repo
      <code>octo-repo-owner/octo-repo</code>, then you can only restore the
      package if the package namespace
      <code>rubygem.pkg.github.com/octo-repo-owner/octo-repo/octo-package</code>
      is still available, and 30 days have not yet passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must also meet one of these permission requirements: - For
      repository-scoped packages: You have admin permissions to the repository
      that owns the deleted package. - For user-account scoped packages: Your
      user account owns the deleted package. - For organization-scoped packages:
      You have admin permissions to the deleted package in the organization that
      owns the package.

      Once the package is restored, the package will use the same namespace it

      be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted
