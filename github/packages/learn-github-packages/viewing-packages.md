## About package views

Your ability to view a package depends on several factors. By default, you can view all packages you have published. 

Repository-scoped packages inherit their permissions and visibility from the repository that owns the package. The registries below use this type of permissions:{% ifversion not fpt %}
- Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`){% endif %}
- npm registry
- RubyGems registry
- Apache Maven registry
- NuGet registry

{% ifversion fpt %}
The Container registry offers you the option of granular permissions and visibility settings that can be customized for each package owned by a personal user or organization account. You can choose to use granular permissions or connect the package to a repository and inherit it's permissions. For more information, see "[Connecting a repository to a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package)."
{% endif %}

For more information, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages){% ifversion fpt %}" and "[Configuring a package's access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility){% endif %}."
