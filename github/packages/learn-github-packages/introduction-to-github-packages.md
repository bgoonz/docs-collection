## About {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} is a platform for hosting and managing packages, including containers and other dependencies. {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} combines your source code and packages in one place to provide integrated permissions management{% ifversion not ghae %} and billing{% endif %}, so you can centralize your software development on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

You can integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} with {% data variables.product.product_name %} APIs, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, and webhooks to create an end-to-end DevOps workflow that includes your code, CI, and deployment solutions.

{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} offers different package registries for commonly used package managers, such as npm, RubyGems, Apache Maven, Gradle, Docker, and NuGet. {% ifversion fpt %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} is optimized for containers and supports Docker and OCI images.{% endif %} For more information on the different package registries that {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} supports, see "[Working with a {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registry](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry)."

### Overview of package permissions and visibility

|                    |        |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Permissions        | {% ifversion fpt %}The permissions for a package are either inherited from the repository where the package is hosted or, for packages in the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, they can be defined for specific user or organization accounts. For more information, see "[Configuring a packageâ€™s access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)." {% else %}Each package inherits the permissions of the repository where the package is hosted. <br> <br> For example, anyone with read permissions for a repository can install a package as a dependency in a project, and anyone with write permissions can publish a new package version.{% endif %} |
| Visibility         | {% data reusables.package_registry.public-or-private-packages %} |

## Managing packages

{% ifversion fpt %}
You can delete a package in the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user interface or using the REST API. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} API](/rest/reference/packages)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes > 3.0 %}
You can delete a private or public package in the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user interface. Or for repo-scoped packages, you can delete a version of a private package using GraphQL.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes < 3.1 %}
You can delete a version of a private package in the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user interface or using the GraphQL API.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae %}
You can delete a version of a package in the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user interface or using the GraphQL API.
{% endif %}

When you use the GraphQL API to query and delete private packages, you must use the same token you use to authenticate to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. For more information, see "{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.0 %}[Deleting and restoring a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package){% elsif ghes < 3.1 or ghae %}[Deleting a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-a-package){% endif %}" and "[Forming calls with GraphQL](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql)."

You can configure webhooks to subscribe to package-related events, such as when a package is published or updated. For more information, see the "[`package` webhook event](/webhooks/event-payloads/#package)."
