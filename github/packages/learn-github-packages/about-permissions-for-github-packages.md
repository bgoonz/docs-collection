{% ifversion fpt %}
The permissions for packages are either repository-scoped or user/organization-scoped.
{% endif %}

## Permissions for repository-scoped packages

A repository-scoped package inherits the permissions and visibility of the repository that owns the package. You can find a package scoped to a repository by going to the main page of the repository and clicking the **Packages** link to the right of the page. {% ifversion fpt %}For more information, see "[Connecting a repository to a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package)."{% endif %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registries below use repository-scoped permissions:

  {% ifversion not fpt %}- Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`){% endif %}
  - npm registry
  - RubyGems registry
  - Apache Maven registry
  - NuGet registry

{% ifversion fpt %}
## Granular permissions for user/organization-scoped packages

Packages with granular permissions are scoped to a personal user or organization account. You can change the access control and visibility of the package separately from a repository that is connected (or linked) to a package.

Currently, only the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} offers granular permissions for your container image packages.

## Visibility and access permissions for container images

{% data reusables.package_registry.visibility-and-access-permissions %}

For more information, see "[Configuring a package's access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)."

{% endif %}

## About scopes and permissions for package registries

To use or manage a package hosted by a package registry, you must use a token with the appropriate scope, and your user account must have appropriate permissions.

For example:
-  To download and install packages from a repository, your token must have the `read:packages` scope, and your user account must have read permission.
- {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.0 %}To delete a package on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your token must at least have the `delete:packages` and `read:packages` scope. The `repo` scope is also required for repo-scoped packages.{% elsif ghes < 3.1 %}To delete a specified version of a private package on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your token must have the `delete:packages` and `repo` scope. Public packages cannot be deleted.{% elsif ghae %}To delete a specified version of a package on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your token must have the `delete:packages` and `repo` scope.{% endif %} For more information, see "{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.0 %}[Deleting and restoring a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package){% elsif ghes < 3.1 or ghae %}[Deleting a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-a-package){% endif %}."

| Scope | Description | Required permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`read:packages`| Download and install packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} | read |
|`write:packages`| Upload and publish packages to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} | write |
| `delete:packages` | {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.0 %} Delete packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} {% elsif ghes < 3.1 %} Delete specified versions of private packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}{% elsif ghae %} Delete specified versions of packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} {% endif %} | admin |
| `repo` | Upload and delete packages (along with `write:packages`, or `delete:packages`) | write or admin |

When you create a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow, you can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to publish and install packages in {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} without needing to store and manage a personal access token.

For more information, see:{% ifversion fpt %}
- "[Configuring a packageâ€™s access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)"{% endif %}
- "[Publishing and installing a package with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions)"
- "[Creating a personal access token](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token/)"
- "[Available scopes](/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes)"

## Maintaining access to packages in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows

To ensure your workflows will maintain access to your packages, ensure that you're using the right access token in your workflow and that you've enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to your package.

For more conceptual background on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or examples of using packages in workflows, see "[Managing GitHub Packages using GitHub Actions workflows](/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows)."

### Access tokens  

- To publish packages associated with the workflow repository, use `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- To install packages associated with other private repositories that `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't access, use a personal access token

For more information about `GITHUB_TOKEN` used in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows, see "[Authentication in a workflow](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)."

{% ifversion fpt %}
### {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access for container images

To ensure your workflows have access to your container image, you must enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to the repositories where your workflow is run. You can find this setting on your package's settings page. For more information, see "[Ensuring workflow access to your package](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility#ensuring-workflow-access-to-your-package)."
