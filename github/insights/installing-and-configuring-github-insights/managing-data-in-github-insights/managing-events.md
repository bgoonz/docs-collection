## About events

Events add context to metrics. For example, holidays or release dates can cause changes in work patterns, so knowing when those events occurred can change your evaluation of metrics. You can create events for the reorganization of teams, start dates of new employees, changes in scope for teams, and anything else that would affect your team's work.

After you create an event in {% data variables.product.prodname_insights %}, anyone can view the event as an annotation in some metrics. For more information, see "[Viewing key metrics and reports](/insights/exploring-your-usage-of-github-enterprise/viewing-key-metrics-and-reports)."
