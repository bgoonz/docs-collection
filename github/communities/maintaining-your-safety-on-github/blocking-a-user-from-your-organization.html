</header>
<p>You can block a user from within your organization’s settings or from a specific comment made by the user. When you block a user in a comment, you can choose to send the user a notification explaining that they were blocked and why. Otherwise, the user is not directly notified that you’ve blocked them. Blocked users can still delete their existing content.</p>
<p>When you block a user, you can choose to block them indefinitely or for a specific amount of time. If you block someone for a specific amount of time, they are automatically unblocked after the chosen time expires. If you block someone indefinitely, you can unblock them manually at any time. For more information, see “<a href="/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/unblocking-a-user-from-your-organization">Unblocking a user from your organization</a>.”</p>
<p>{% tip %}</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see “<a href="/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations">Locking conversations</a>.”</p>
<p>{% endtip %}</p>
<p>At the time that you block a user from your organization: - The user stops watching your organization’s repositories - The user’s stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories - The user’s votes on discussions or comments in your organization’s repositories are deleted - The user is removed as a collaborator on your organization’s repositories - The user’s contributions to your organization’s repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them - Any pending repository or organization invitations to the blocked user are cancelled</p>
<p>After you’ve blocked a user from your organization, they cannot: - Cross-reference your organization’s repositories in comments - Fork, watch, pin, or star your organization’s repositories</p>
<p>In your organization’s repositories, blocked users also cannot: - Open issues - Send, close, or merge pull requests - Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits - Add or edit wiki pages</p>
