After unblocking a user from your organization, they'll be able to contribute to your organization's repositories.

If you selected a specific amount of time to block the user, they will be automatically unblocked when that period of time ends. For more information, see "[Blocking a user from your organization](/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization)."

{% tip %}

**Tip**: Any settings that were removed when you blocked the user from your organization, such as collaborator status, stars, and watches, will not be restored when you unblock the user.

{% endtip %}
