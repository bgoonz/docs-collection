---

You can block a user from within your organization's settings or from a specific comment made by the user. When you block a user in a comment, you can choose to send the user a notification explaining that they were blocked and why. Otherwise, the user is not directly notified that you've blocked them. Blocked users can still delete their existing content.

When you block a user, you can choose to block them indefinitely or for a specific amount of time. If you block someone for a specific amount of time, they are automatically unblocked after the chosen time expires. If you block someone indefinitely, you can unblock them manually at any time. For more information, see "[Unblocking a user from your organization](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/unblocking-a-user-from-your-organization)."

{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see "[Locking conversations](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

{% endtip %}

At the time that you block a user from your organization:
- The user stops watching your organization's repositories
- The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories
- The user's votes on discussions or comments in your organization's repositories are deleted
- The user is removed as a collaborator on your organization's repositories
- The user's contributions to your organization's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them
- Any pending repository or organization invitations to the blocked user are cancelled

After you've blocked a user from your organization, they cannot:
- Cross-reference your organization's repositories in comments
- Fork, watch, pin, or star your organization's repositories

In your organization's repositories, blocked users also cannot:
- Open issues
- Send, close, or merge pull requests
- Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
- Add or edit wiki pages

## Blocking a user in a comment

1. Navigate to the comment whose author you would like to block.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}, then click **Block user**.
