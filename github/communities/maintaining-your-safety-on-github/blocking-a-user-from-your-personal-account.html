<h2 id="about-blocking-users">About blocking users</h2>
<p>You can block a user in your account settings or from the user’s profile. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will not notify the user when you block them. If you want to avoid contributing to the same project as someone you’ve blocked, you can choose to display a warning on any repositories with prior contributions from a blocked user. For more information, see “<a href="#blocking-a-user-in-your-account-settings">Blocking a user in your account settings</a>.” You may still see the activity of blocked users in shared spaces and blocked users can delete their existing content.</p>
<p>{% tip %}</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see “<a href="/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations">Locking conversations</a>.”</p>
<p>{% endtip %}</p>
<p>When you block a user: - The user stops following you - The user stops watching and unpins your repositories - The user is not able to join any organizations you are an owner of - The user’s stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories - The user’s votes on discussions or comments in your repositories are deleted - The user is removed as a collaborator on your repositories - The user’s contributions to your repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them - Your contributions to the blocked user’s repositories are no longer counted as contributions for you - You are removed as a collaborator on their repositories - Their sponsorship of you is cancelled - Any pending repository or account successor invitations to or from the blocked user are cancelled</p>
<p>After you’ve blocked a user, they cannot: - Send you any notifications, including by <span class="citation" data-cites="mentioning">[@mentioning]</span>(/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) your username - Comment on or edit issues or pull requests that you’ve created - React to your comments on issues, pull requests, and commits - Follow you or see your content in their activity feed - Assign you to issues or pull requests - Invite you as a collaborator on their repositories - Invite you as a collaborator on a security advisory - Cross-reference your repositories in comments - Fork, watch, pin, or star your repositories - Sponsor you</p>
<p>In repositories you own, blocked users also cannot: - Open issues - Send, close, or merge pull requests - Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits - Add or edit wiki pages</p>
