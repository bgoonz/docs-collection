## About blocking users

You can block a user in your account settings or from the user's profile. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will not notify the user when you block them. If you want to avoid contributing to the same project as someone you've blocked, you can choose to display a warning on any repositories with prior contributions from a blocked user. For more information, see "[Blocking a user in your account settings](#blocking-a-user-in-your-account-settings)." You may still see the activity of blocked users in shared spaces and blocked users can delete their existing content.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see "[Locking conversations](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

{% endtip %}

When you block a user:
- The user stops following you
- The user stops watching and unpins your repositories
- The user is not able to join any organizations you are an owner of
- The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories
- The user's votes on discussions or comments in your repositories are deleted
- The user is removed as a collaborator on your repositories
- The user's contributions to your repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them
- Your contributions to the blocked user's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for you
- You are removed as a collaborator on their repositories
- Their sponsorship of you is cancelled
- Any pending repository or account successor invitations to or from the blocked user are cancelled

After you've blocked a user, they cannot:
- Send you any notifications, including by [@mentioning](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) your username
- Comment on or edit issues or pull requests that you've created
- React to your comments on issues, pull requests, and commits
- Follow you or see your content in their activity feed
- Assign you to issues or pull requests
- Invite you as a collaborator on their repositories
- Invite you as a collaborator on a security advisory
- Cross-reference your repositories in comments
- Fork, watch, pin, or star your repositories
- Sponsor you

In repositories you own, blocked users also cannot:
- Open issues
- Send, close, or merge pull requests
- Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
- Add or edit wiki pages
