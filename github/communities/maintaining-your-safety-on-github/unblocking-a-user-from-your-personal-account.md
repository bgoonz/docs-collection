When you unblock a user, they'll be able to invite you to be a collaborator to their repositories. If they [@mention you](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) anywhere on GitHub, you'll receive notifications.

In repositories you own, the user will be able to collaborate normally.

You can unblock a user in your account settings or from the user's profile page.

## Unblocking a user in your account settings

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.blocked_users %}
3. Under "Blocked users", next to the user you'd like to unblock, click **Unblock**.

2. In the left sidebar, under the user's profile picture, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}, then click  **Unblock or report user**.
