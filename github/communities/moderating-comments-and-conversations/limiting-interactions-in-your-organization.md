## About temporary interaction limits

Limiting interactions in your organization enables temporary interaction limits for all public repositories owned by the organization. {% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-restrictions %}

{% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-duration %} After the duration of your limit passes, users can resume normal activity in your organization's public repositories.

{% data reusables.community.types-of-interaction-limits %}

Members of the organization are not affected by any of the limit types.

When you enable organization-wide activity limitations, you can't enable or disable interaction limits on individual repositories. For more information on limiting activity for an individual repository, see "[Limiting interactions in your repository](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository)."

Organization owners can also block users for a specific amount of time. After the block expires, the user is automatically unblocked. For more information, see "[Blocking a user from your organization](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization)."
