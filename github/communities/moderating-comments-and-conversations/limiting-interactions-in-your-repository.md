## About temporary interaction limits

{% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-restrictions %}

{% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-duration %} After the duration of your limit passes, users can resume normal activity in your repository.

{% data reusables.community.types-of-interaction-limits %}

You can also enable activity limitations on all repositories owned by your user account or an organization. If a user-wide or organization-wide limit is enabled, you can't limit activity for individual repositories owned by the account. For more information, see "[Limiting interactions for your user account](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-for-your-user-account)" and "[Limiting interactions in your organization](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-organization)."
