Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can view and manage reported content for the repository.

## About management of reported content

Before you can view or manage reported content, you must enable reported content for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing how contributors report abuse in your organization's repository](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-how-contributors-report-abuse-in-your-organizations-repository)."

You can track, triage, and respond to reports of disruptive content. In the "Abuse reports" list, you can view all reports and navigate directly to each reported comment on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

{% data reusables.community.tools-for-moderating %}

After you finish moderating disruptive content, you can mark the report as resolved. If you decide that you're not done moderating, you can also mark the report as unresolved.

## Viewing content that a contributor reported

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-moderation-reported-content %}
4. To the right of the reported content you'd like to view, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The edit icon" %}, then click **View content**.
