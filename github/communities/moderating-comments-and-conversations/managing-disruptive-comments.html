    <p>
      Anyone with write access to a repository can hide comments on issues, pull
      requests, and commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a
      comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to
      navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read
      access to the repository can expand them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull
      requests, and commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn’t
      contribute to the conversation and violates your community’s code of
      conduct{% ifversion fpt %} or GitHub’s
      <a href="/articles/github-community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>{%
      endif %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you edit a comment, note the location that the content was removed
      from and optionally, the reason for removing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment’s edit history.
      The <strong>edited</strong> dropdown at the top of the comment contains a
      history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also
      delete sensitive information from a comment’s edit history. For more
      information, see “<a

        edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.

    <h2 id="deleting-a-comment">Deleting a comment</h2>
    <p>
      Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues,
      pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the
      comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It’s appropriate to
      delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a
      conversation and violates your community’s code of conduct{% ifversion fpt
      %} or GitHub’s
      <a href="/articles/github-community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>{%
      endif %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with
      read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who
      deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the
      repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is
      anonymized.

      />
      <figcaption>Anonymized timeline event for a deleted comment</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the
      conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull
      request can’t be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request
      bodies to remove unwanted content.
