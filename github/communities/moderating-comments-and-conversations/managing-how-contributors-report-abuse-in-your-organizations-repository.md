Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can manage how contributors report abuse in the repository.

You can enable or disable reported content for public repositories owned by an organization.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-moderation-reported-content %}
4. Under "Reported content", select or unselect **Accept content reports from collaborators and prior contributors**.
