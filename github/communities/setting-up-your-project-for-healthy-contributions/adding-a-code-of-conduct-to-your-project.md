shortTitle: Add a code of conduct
---

A *code of conduct* defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. For more information on why a code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how to engage in a community, see the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/).

Before adopting a code of conduct for your project:

* Research different codes of conduct designed for open source projects. Choose one that reflects your community's standards.
* Consider carefully whether you are willing and able to enforce it.

You can add a code of conduct to your project by using a template or manually creating a custom code of conduct. Your code of conduct will be available either way, but "Code of conduct" will only be marked as complete in your repository's community profile if you use a template. If you use a code of conduct written by another person or organization, be sure to follow any attribution guidelines from the source. For more information about community profiles, see "[About community profiles for public repositories](//communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories)."

You can create a default code of conduct for your organization or user account. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

## Adding a code of conduct using a template

{% data variables.product.product_name %} provides templates for common codes of conduct to help you quickly add a code of conduct to your project.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.files.add-file %}
3. In the file name field, type *CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md*.
4. Click **Choose a code of conduct template**.

{% data reusables.files.write_commit_message %}
{% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
{% data reusables.files.propose_new_file %}

## Adding a code of conduct manually

If the code of conduct you want to use isn't available in the provided templates, you can manually add a code of conduct.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.files.add-file %}
3. In the file name field, type the name and extension for the file.
  ![New code of conduct file name](/assets/images/help/repository/new-code-of-conduct-file-name.png)
    - To make your code of conduct visible in the repository's root directory, type *CODE_OF_CONDUCT* in the file name field.
    - To make your code of conduct visible in the repository's `docs` directory, type *docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT*.
    - To make your code of conduct visible in the repository's `.github` directory, type *.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT*.
4. In the new file, add your custom code of conduct.
{% data reusables.files.write_commit_message %}
{% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
{% data reusables.files.propose_new_file %}
