<p>As a repository maintainer, you can author guidelines for contributing to your project and share them in the project’s repository. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} offers a community profile checklist to help you author and publish community health files. Potential contributors to your project can review the community profile checklist to learn about your community’s standards and decide whether they want to contribute.

<p>Contributors can always report disruptive content to {% data variables.contact.github_support %}. If you opt into reported content for a public repository in your organization, contributors can also report comments containing disruptive behavior directly to repository maintainers. For more information, see “<a href="/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-reported-content-in-your-organizations-repository">Managing reported content in your organization’s repository</a>.”</p>
