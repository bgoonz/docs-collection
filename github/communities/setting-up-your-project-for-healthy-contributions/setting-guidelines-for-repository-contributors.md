## About contributing guidelines
To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file. The link to the contributing guidelines also appears on your repository's `contribute` page. For an example of a `contribute` page, see [github/docs/contribute](https://github.com/github/docs/contribute).

For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.

For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.

For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.

You can create default contribution guidelines for your organization{% ifversion fpt or ghes %} or user account{% endif %}. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](//communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

{% endif %}

{% tip %}

**Tip:** Repository maintainers can set specific guidelines for issues by creating an issue or pull request template for the repository. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."

{% endtip %}

## Adding a *CONTRIBUTING* file

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.files.add-file %}
3. Decide whether to store your contributing guidelines in your repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` directory. Then, in the filename field, type the name and extension for the file. Contributing guidelines filenames are not case sensitive. Files are rendered in rich text format if the file extension is in a supported format. For more information, see "[Rendering differences in prose documents](/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/rendering-differences-in-prose-documents)."
  ![New file name](/assets/images/help/repository/new-file-name.png)
    - To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's root directory, type *CONTRIBUTING*.
    - To make your contributing guidelines visible in the repository's `docs` directory, type *docs/* to create the new directory, then *CONTRIBUTING*.
    - If a repository contains more than one *CONTRIBUTING* file, then the file shown in links is chosen from locations in the following order: the `.github` directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the `docs` directory.
4. In the new file, add contribution guidelines. These could include:
    - Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
    - Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
    - Community and behavioral expectations.
{% data reusables.files.write_commit_message %}
{% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
{% data reusables.files.propose_new_file %}
