      About default community health files
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can add default community health files to the root of a public
      repository called <code>.github</code> that is owned by an organization{%
      ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes %} or user account{% endif %}.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.product_name %} will use and display default
      files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own
      file of that type in any of the following places: - the root of the
      repository - the <code>.github</code> folder - the
      <code>docs</code> folder
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a repository
      that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to the
      default CONTRIBUTING file. If a repository has any files in its own
      <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes
      %}, including issue templates or a <em>config.yml</em> file,{% endif %}
      none of the contents of the default
      <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of
      individual repositories because they are stored only in the
      <code>.github</code> repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="supported-file-types">Supported file types</h2>
    <p>
      You can create defaults in your organization{% ifversion fpt or ghae or
      ghes %} or user account{% endif %} for the following community health
      files:
    </p>
    <p>
      Community health file | Description — | —{% ifversion fpt %}
      <em>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</em> | A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for
      how to engage in a community. For more information, see “<a

    <p>
      You cannot create a default license file. License files must be added to
      individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is
      cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
