    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} is a collaborative
      communication forum for the community around an open source project.
      Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and
      accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not
      related to code, unlike {% data variables.product.prodname_github_issues
      %}. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by
      connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data
      variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public
      and private repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you first enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %},
      you will be invited to configure a welcome post.

      Welcoming contributions to your discussions
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a
      repository by creating a welcome post and pinning the post to your {% data
      variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking
      discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You
      can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer
      guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information
      about pinning a discussion, see “<a
        href="/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion"
        >Managing discussions in your repository</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="setting-up-community-guidelines-for-contributors">
      Setting up community guidelines for contributors
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have
      meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You
      can also update the repository’s README to communicate expectations on
      when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see “<a

    <h2 id="organizing-discussions">Organizing discussions</h2>
    <p>
      Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories
      to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating
      new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing
      categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository"
        >Managing categories for discussions in your repository</a

      Promoting healthy conversations
    </h2>
    <p>
      People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important
      conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no
      longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring
      discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For
      more information, see “<a
        href="/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository"
        >Managing discussions in your repository</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a
      project’s discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions
      that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting
      issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of
      development. For more information, see “<a
        href="/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions"
        >Moderating discussions</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
    <p>
      Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept
      to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress. For
      more information on creating an issue from a discussion, see “<a
        href="/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions"
        >Moderating discussions</a
