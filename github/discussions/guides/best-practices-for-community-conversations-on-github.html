    <p>
      Since {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} is an open forum,
      there is an opportunity to bring non-code collaboration into a project’s
      repository and gather diverse feedback and ideas more quickly. You can
      help drive a productive conversation by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Asking pointed questions and follow-up questions to garner specific
        feedback
      </li>
      <li>Capture a diverse experience and distill it down to main points</li>
      <li>
        Open an issue to take action based on the conversation, where applicable
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more information about opening an issue and cross-referencing a
      discussion, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-a-comment"
        >Opening an issue from a comment</a

    <h2 id="learning-about-conversations-on-github">
      Learning about conversations on GitHub
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can create and participate in discussions, issues, and pull requests,
      depending on the type of conversation you’d like to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} to discuss
      big picture ideas, brainstorm, and spike out a project’s specific details
      before committing it to an issue, which can then be scoped. {% data
      variables.product.prodname_discussions %} is useful for teams if: - You
      are in the discovery phase of a project and are still learning which
      director your team wants to go in - You want to collect feedback from a
      wider community about a project - You want to keep bug fixes, feature
      requests, and general conversations separate
    </p>
    <p>
      Issues are useful for discussing specific details of a project such as bug
      reports and planned improvements. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/about-issues"
        >About issues</a
      >.” Pull requests allow you to comment directly on proposed changes. For
      more information, see “<a href="/articles/about-pull-requests"
        >About pull requests</a
      >” and “<a href="/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request"
        >Commenting on a pull request</a
      >.”

      Following contributing guidelines
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before you open a discussion, check to see if the repository has
      contributing guidelines. The CONTRIBUTING file includes information about
      how the repository maintainer would like you to contribute ideas to the
      project.
