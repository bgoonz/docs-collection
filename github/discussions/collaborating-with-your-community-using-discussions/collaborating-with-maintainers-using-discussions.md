## About collaboration with maintainers using {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}

{% data reusables.discussions.about-discussions %} If you use or contribute to a project, you can start a discussion to make suggestions and engage with maintainers and community members about your plans, questions, ideas, and feedback. For more information, see "[â€ŽAbout discussions](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)."

{% data reusables.discussions.about-categories-and-formats %} {% data reusables.discussions.about-announcement-format %} 

Repository administrators and project maintainers can delete a discussion. For more information, see "[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#deleting-a-discussion)."

{% data reusables.discussions.github-recognizes-members %} These members appear in a list of the most helpful contributors to the project's discussions. As your project grows, you can grant higher access permissions to active members of your community.
