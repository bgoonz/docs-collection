## About security vulnerabilities

{% data reusables.repositories.a-vulnerability-is %}

{% data variables.product.product_name %} will send you {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} if we detect that any of the vulnerabilities from the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} affect the packages that your repository depends on. For more information, see "[About alerts for vulnerable dependencies](/code-security/supply-chain-security/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} contains a curated list of security vulnerabilities that have been mapped to packages tracked by the {% data variables.product.company_short %} dependency graph. {% data reusables.repositories.tracks-vulnerabilities %}

Each security advisory contains information about the vulnerability, including the description, severity, affected package, package ecosystem, affected versions and patched versions, impact, and optional information such as references, workarounds, and credits. In addition, advisories from the National Vulnerability Database list contain a link to the CVE record, where you can read more details about the vulnerability, its CVSS scores, and its qualitative severity level. For more information, see the "[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)" from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The severity level is one of four possible levels defined in the "[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Section 5](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)."
- Low
- Medium/Moderate
- High
- Critical

The {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} uses the CVSS levels described above. If {% data variables.product.company_short %} obtains a CVE, the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} uses CVSS version 3.1. If the CVE is imported, the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} supports both CVSS versions 3.0 and 3.1.
