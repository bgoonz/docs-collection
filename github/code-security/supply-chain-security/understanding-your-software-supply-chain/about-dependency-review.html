      If a pull request targets your repository’s default branch and contains
      changes to package manifests or lock files, you can display a dependency
      review to see what has changed. The dependency review includes details of
      changes to indirect dependencies in lock files, and it tells you if any of
      the added or updated dependencies contain known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>Dependency review is available in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All public repositories.</li>
      <li>
        Private repositories owned by organizations with an {% data
        variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} license that have the
        dependency graph enabled. For more information, see “<a
          href="/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#enabling-and-disabling-the-dependency-graph-for-a-private-repository"
          >Exploring the dependencies of a repository</a
        >.”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes you might just want to update the version of one dependency in a
      manifest and generate a pull request. However, if the updated version of
      this direct dependency also has updated dependencies, your pull request
      may have more changes than you expected. The dependency review for each
      manifest and lock file provides an easy way to see what has changed, and
      whether any of the new dependency versions contain known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      By checking the dependency reviews in a pull request, and changing any
      dependencies that are flagged as vulnerable, you can avoid vulnerabilities
      being added to your project. For more information about how dependency
      review works, see “<a
        href="/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request"
        >Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} will find
      vulnerabilities that are already in your dependencies, but it’s much
      better to avoid introducing potential problems than to fix problems at a
      later date. For more information about {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies#dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies"
        >About alerts for vulnerable dependencies</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dependency review supports the same languages and package management
      ecosystems as the dependency graph. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph#supported-package-ecosystems"
        >About the dependency graph</a
