{% warning %}

Dependabot Preview will be shut down on August 3rd, 2021. In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then.

After that date, any open pull requests from Dependabot Preview will remain open, but the bot itself will no longer work on your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} accounts and organizations.

{% endwarning %}

## About upgrading from Dependabot Preview to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}

Dependabot Preview has been built directly into {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, so you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alongside all the other functionality in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} without having to install and use a separate application. By migrating to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, we can also focus on bringing lots of exciting new features to {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, including more [ecosystem updates](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/150), [improved notifications](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/133), and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} support for [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/86) and [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/135).

## Differences between Dependabot Preview and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}

While most of the Dependabot Preview features exist in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, a few remain unavailable: 
- **Live updates:** We hope to bring these back in the future. For now, you can run {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} daily to catch new packages within one day of release.
- **PHP environment variable registries:** For projects that rely on the `ACF_PRO_KEY` environment variable, you may be able to vendor your licensed copy of the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. For an example, see [dependabot/acf-php-example](https://github.com/dependabot/acf-php-example#readme). For other environment variables, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to fetch dependencies from these registries.
- **Auto-merge:** We always recommend verifying your dependencies before merging them; therefore, auto-merge will not be supported for the foreseeable future. For those of you who have vetted your dependencies, or are only using internal dependencies, we recommend adding third-party auto-merge apps, or setting up GitHub Actions to merge.

In {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, you can configure all version updates using the configuration file. This file is similar to the Dependabot Preview configuration file with a few changes and improvements that will be automatically included in your upgrade pull request. For more information about the upgrade pull request, see "[Upgrading to GitHub-native Dependabot](/code-security/supply-chain-security/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot#upgrading-to-github-native-dependabot)".

To see update logs for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} that were previously on the Dependabot.com dashboard:

  1. Navigate to your repositoryâ€™s **Insights** page.
  2. Click **Dependency graph** to the left.
  3. Click **{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}**.

For more information about version updates with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/code-security/supply-chain-security/about-dependabot-version-updates)."

## Upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}

Upgrading from Dependabot Preview to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} requires you to merge the *Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot* pull request in your repository. This pull request includes the updated configuration file needed for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-native {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}.

If you are using private repositories, you will have to grant Dependabot access to these repositories in your organization's security and analysis settings. For more information, see "[Allowing Dependabot to access private dependencies](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#allowing-dependabot-to-access-private-dependencies)". Previously, Dependabot had access to all repositories within an organization, but we implemented this change because it is much safer to use the principle of least privilege for Dependabot.

If you are using private registries, you will have to add your existing Dependabot Preview secrets to your repository's or organization's "Dependabot secrets". For more information, see "[Managing encrypted secrets for Dependabot](/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-dependabot)".

If you have any questions or need help migrating, you can view or open issues in the [dependabot/dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/new?assignees=%40dependabot%2Fpreview-migration-reviewers&labels=E%3A+preview-migration&template=migration-issue.md&title=) repository.
