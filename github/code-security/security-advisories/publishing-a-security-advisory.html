    <p>
      Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can publish the
      security advisory.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Before you can publish a security advisory or request a CVE identification
      number, you must create a draft security advisory and provide information
      about the versions of your project affected by the security vulnerability.
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory"
        >Creating a security advisory</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve created a security advisory but haven’t yet provided details
      about the versions of your project that the security vulnerability
      affects, you can edit the security advisory. For more information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/editing-a-security-advisory"
        >Editing a security advisory</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="about-publishing-a-security-advisory">
      About publishing a security advisory
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you publish a security advisory, you notify your community about the
      security vulnerability that the security advisory addresses. Publishing a
      security advisory makes it easier for your community to update package
      dependencies and research the impact of the security vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>{% data reusables.repositories.security-advisories-republishing %}</p>
    <p>
      Before you publish a security advisory, you can privately collaborate to
      fix the vulnerability in a temporary private fork. For more information,
      see “<a
        href="/articles/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-security-vulnerability"
        >Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a security
        vulnerability</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>{% warning %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning</strong>: Whenever possible, you should always add a fix
      version to a security advisory prior to publishing the advisory. If you
      don’t, the advisory will be published without a fixed version, and {% data
      variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} will alert your users about the
      issue, without offering any safe version to update to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend you take the following steps in these different situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a fix version is imminently available, and you are able to, wait to
        disclose the issue when the fix is ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a fix version is in development but not yet available, mention this
        in the advisory, and edit the advisory later, after publication.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are not planning to fix the issue, be clear about it in the
        advisory so that your users don’t contact you to ask when a fix will be
        made. In this case, it is helpful to include steps users can take to
        mitigate the issue.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% endwarning %}</p>
    <p>
      When you publish a draft advisory from a public repository, everyone is
      able to see:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current version of the advisory data.</li>
      <li>Any advisory credits that the credited users have accepted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>{% note %}</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: The general public will never have access to the
      edit history of the advisory, and will only see the published version.
    </p>
    <p>{% endnote %}</p>
    <p>
      After you publish a security advisory, the URL for the security advisory
      will remain the same as before you published the security advisory. Anyone
      with read access to the repository can see the security advisory.
      Collaborators on the security advisory can continue to view past
      conversations, including the full comment stream, in the security advisory
      unless someone with admin permissions removes the collaborator from the
      security advisory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to update or correct information in a security advisory that
      you’ve published, you can edit the security advisory. For more
      information, see “<a
        href="/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/editing-a-security-advisory"
        >Editing a security advisory</a
