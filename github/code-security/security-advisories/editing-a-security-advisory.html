<p>People with admin permissions to a security advisory can edit the security advisory.</p>
<h2 id="about-credits-for-security-advisories">About credits for security advisories</h2>
<p>You can credit people who helped discover, report, or fix a security vulnerability. If you credit someone, they can choose to accept or decline credit.</p>
<p>If someone accepts credit, the person’s username appears in the “Credits” section of the security advisory. Anyone with read access to the repository can see the advisory and the people who accepted credit for it.</p>
<p>If you believe you should be credited for a security advisory, please contact the person who created the advisory and ask them to edit the advisory to include your credit. Only the creator of the advisory can credit you, so please don’t contact GitHub Support about credits for security advisories.</p>
