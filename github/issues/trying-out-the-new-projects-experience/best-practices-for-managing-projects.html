      You can use projects to manage your work on {% data
      variables.product.company_short %}, where your issues and pull requests
      live. Read on for tips to manage your projects efficiently and
      effectively. For more information about projects, see “<a
        href="/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects"
        >About projects</a
      >.”

    <h2 id="break-down-large-issues-into-smaller-issues">
      Break down large issues into smaller issues
    </h2>
    <p>
      Breaking a large issue into smaller issues makes the work more manageable
      and enables team members to work in parallel. It also leads to smaller
      pull requests, which are easier to review.
    </p>
    <p>
      To track how smaller issues fit into the larger goal, use task lists,
      milestones, or labels. For more information, see “<a
        href="/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/about-task-lists"
        >About task lists</a
      >”, “<a
        href="/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones"
        >About milestones</a
      >”, and “<a
        href="/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels"
        >Managing labels</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="communicate">Communicate</h2>
    <p>
      Issues and pull requests include built-in features to let you easily
      communicate with your collaborators. Use
      <span class="citation" data-cites="mentions">@mentions</span> to alert a
      person or entire team about a comment. Assign collaborators to issues to
      communicate responsibility. Link to related issues or pull requests to
      communicate how they are connected.
    </p>
    <h2 id="use-views">Use views</h2>
    <p>Use project views to look at your project from different angles.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filter by status to view all un-started items</li>
      <li>
        Group by a custom priority field to monitor the volume of high priority
        items
      </li>
      <li>
        Sort by a custom date field to view the items with the earliest target
        ship date
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more information, see “<a
        href="/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/customizing-your-project-views"
        >Customizing your project views</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="have-a-single-source-of-truth">Have a single source of truth</h2>
    <p>
      To prevent information from getting out of sync, maintain a single source
      of truth. For example, track a target ship date in a single location
      instead of spread across multiple fields. Then, if the target ship date
      shifts, you only need to update the date in one location.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% data variables.product.company_short %} projects automatically stay up
      to date with {% data variables.product.company_short %} data, such as
      assignees, milestones, and labels. When one of these fields changes in an
      issue or pull request, the change is automatically reflected in your
      project.
    </p>
    <h2 id="use-automation">Use automation</h2>
    <p>
      Automating tasks lets you spend less time on busy work and more time on
      the project itself. The less you need to remember to do manually, the more
      likely your project will stay up to date. {% data
      variables.product.prodname_actions %} and the GraphQL API enable you to
      automate routine project management tasks. For example, to keep track of
      pull requests awaiting review, you can create a workflow that adds a pull
      request to a project and sets the status to “needs review”; this process
      can be automatically triggered when a pull request is marked as “ready for
      review”.
    </p>
