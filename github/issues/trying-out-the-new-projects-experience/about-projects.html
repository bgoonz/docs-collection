    <h2 id="about-projects">About projects</h2>
    <p>
      A project is a customizable spreadsheet that integrates with your issues
      and pull requests on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. You can
      customize the layout by filtering, sorting, and grouping your issues and
      PRs. You can also add custom fields to track metadata. Projects are
      flexible so that your team can work in the way that is best for them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="staying-up-to-date">Staying up-to-date</h3>
    <p>
      Your project automatically stays up-to-date with the information on {%
      data variables.product.company_short %}. When a pull request or issue
      changes, your project reflects that change. This integration also works
      both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or
      issue from your project, the pull request or issue reflects that
      information.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adding-metadata-to-your-tasks">Adding metadata to your tasks</h3>
    <p>
      You can use custom fields to add metadata to your tasks. For example, you
      can track the following metadata:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a date field to track target ship dates</li>
      <li>a number field to track the complexity of a task</li>
      <li>
        a single select field to track whether a task is Low, Medium, or High
        priority
      </li>
      <li>a text field to add a quick note</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="viewing-your-project-from-different-perspectives">
      Viewing your project from different perspectives
    </h3>
    <p>You can view your project as a high density table layout:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/issues/projects_table.png"
        alt="Project table"
      />
      <figcaption>Project table</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Or as a board:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/issues/projects_board.png"
        alt="Project board"
      />
      <figcaption>Project board</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      To help you focus on specific aspects of your project, you can group,
      sort, or filter items:

      command palette guides you so that you don’t need to memorize custom
      keyboard shortcuts. For more information, see “<a
