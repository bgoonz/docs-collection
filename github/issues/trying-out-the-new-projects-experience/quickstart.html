    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This guide demonstrates how to use projects (beta) to plan and track work.
      In this guide, you will create a new project and add a custom field to
      track priorities for your tasks. You’ll also learn how to create saved
      views that help you communicate priorities and progress with your
      collaborators.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      To create a project, you need a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom
      %} organization that is a part of the projects beta. For more information
      about creating an organization, see “<a
        href="/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch"
        >Creating a new organization from scratch</a
      >.” For more information about the beta, see “<a
        href="/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects"
        >About projects (beta)</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In this guide, you will add existing issues from repositories in your
      organization to your new project. For more information about creating
      issues, see “<a
        href="/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue"
        >Creating an issue</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h2>
    <p>First, create a project from your organization’s project page.</p>
    <p>{% data reusables.projects.create-project %}</p>
    <h2 id="adding-issues-to-your-project">Adding issues to your project</h2>
    <p>Next, add a few issues to your project.</p>
    <p>
      When your new project initializes, it prompts you to add items to your
      project. If you lose this view or want to add more issues later, place
      your cursor in the bottom row of the project, next to the {% octicon
      “plus” aria-label=“plus icon” %}.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Type <code>#</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Select the repository where your issue is located. To narrow down the
        options, you can start typing a part of the repository name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select your issue. To narrow down the options, you can start typing a
        part of the issue title.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Repeat the above steps a few times to add multiple issues to your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about other ways to add issues to your project, or
      about other items you can add to your project, see “<a
        href="/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/creating-a-project#adding-items-to-your-project"
        >Creating a project</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="creating-a-field-to-track-priority">
      Creating a field to track priority
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now, create a custom field called <code>Priority</code> to contain the
      values: <code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, or <code>Low</code>.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>{% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}</li>
      <li>Start typing any part of “Create new field”.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Create new field</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        In the resulting pop-up, enter <code>Priority</code> in the text box.
      </li>
      <li>In the drop-down, select <strong>Single select</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        Add options for <code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, and
        <code>Low</code>. You can also include emojis in your options.

          src="/assets/images/help/projects/new-single-select-field.png"
          alt="New single select field example"
        />
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Specify a priority for all issues in your project.</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/projects/priority_example.png"
        alt="Example priorities"
      />
      <figcaption>Example priorities</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="grouping-issues-by-priority">Grouping issues by priority</h2>
    <p>
      Next, group all of the items in your project by priority to make it easier
      to focus on the high priority items.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>{% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}</li>
      <li>Start typing any part of “Group by”.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Group by: Priority</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, move issues between groups to change their priority.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Choose an issue.</li>
      <li>
        Drag and drop the issue into a different priority group. When you do
        this, the priority of the issue will change to be the priority of its
        new group.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/projects/move_between_group.gif"
        alt="Move issue between groups"
      />
      <figcaption>Move issue between groups</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="saving-the-priority-view">Saving the priority view</h2>
    <p>
      When you grouped your issues by priority in the previous step, your
      project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save
      these changes so that your collaborators will also see the tasks grouped
      by priority.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Select the drop-down menu next to the view name.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To indicate the purpose of the view, give it a descriptive name.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Place your cursor in the current view name, <strong>View 1</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace the existing text with the new name, <code>Priorities</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can share the URL with your team to keep everyone aligned on the
      project priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a view is saved, anyone who opens the project will see the saved
      view. Here, you grouped by priority, but you can also add other modifiers
      such as sort, filter, or layout. Next, you will create a new view with the
      layout modified.
    </p>
    <h2 id="adding-a-board-view">Adding a board view</h2>
    <p>
      To view the progress of your project’s issues, you can switch to board
      layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board view is based on the status field, so specify a status for each
      issue in your project.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/projects/status_example.png"
        alt="Example status"
      />
      <figcaption>Example status</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Then, create a new view.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Click {% octicon “plus” aria-label=“the plus icon” %}
        <strong>New view</strong> next to the rightmost view.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Next, switch to board layout.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>{% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}</li>
      <li>Start typing any part of “Switch layout: Board”.</li>
      <li>
        Select <strong>Switch layout: Board</strong>.
        <img
          src="/assets/images/help/projects/example_board.png"
          alt="Example priorities"
        />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you changed the layout, your project displayed an indicator to show
      that the view was modified. Save this view so that you and your
      collaborators can easily access it in the future.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Select the drop-down menu next to the view name.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To indicate the purpose of the view, give it a descriptive name.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Place your cursor in the current view name, <strong>View 2</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace the existing text with the new name, <code>Progress</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/assets/images/help/projects/project-view-switch.gif"
        alt="Example priorities"
      />
      <figcaption>Example priorities</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
    <p>You can use projects for a wide range of purposes. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track work for a release</li>
      <li>Plan a sprint</li>
      <li>Prioritize a backlog</li>
    </ul>
