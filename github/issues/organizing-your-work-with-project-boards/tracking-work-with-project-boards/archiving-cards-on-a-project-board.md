Automation in your project board does not apply to archived project board cards. For example, if you close an issue in a project board's archive, the archived card does not automatically move to the "Done" column. When you restore a card from the project board archive, the card will return to the column where it was archived.

## Archiving cards on a project board

1. In a project board, find the card you want archive, then click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}.
