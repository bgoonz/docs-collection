You can add issue or pull request cards to your project board by:
- Dragging cards from the **Triage** section in the sidebar.
- Typing the issue or pull request URL in a card.
- Searching for issues or pull requests in the project board search sidebar.

You can put a maximum of 2,500 cards into each project column. If a column has reached the maximum number of cards, no cards can be moved into that column.

{% note %}

**Note:** You can also add notes to your project board to serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or to add related information to your project board. For more information, see "[Adding notes to a project board](/articles/adding-notes-to-a-project-board)."

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.project-management.edit-in-project %}

{% data reusables.project-management.link-repos-to-project-board %} When you search for issues and pull requests to add to your project board, the search automatically scopes to your linked repositories. You can remove these qualifiers to search within all organization repositories. For more information, see "[Linking a repository to a project board](/articles/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board)."

## Adding issues and pull requests to a project board

1. Navigate to the project board where you want to add issues and pull requests.
2. In your project board, click {% octicon "plus" aria-label="The plus icon" %} **Add cards**.

  {% tip %}

  **Tips:**
    - You can also add an issue or pull request by typing the URL in a card.
    - If you're working on a specific feature, you can apply a label to each related issue or pull request for that feature, and then easily add cards to your project board by searching for the label name. For more information, see "[Apply labels to issues and pull requests](/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests)."

  {% endtip %}
4. From the filtered list of issues and pull requests, drag the card you'd like to add to your project board and drop it in the correct column. Alternatively, you can move cards using keyboard shortcuts. {% data reusables.project-management.for-more-info-project-keyboard-shortcuts %}

    **Tip:** You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards and move them between columns. {% data reusables.project-management.for-more-info-project-keyboard-shortcuts %}
