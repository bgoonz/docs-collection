      You can add issue or pull request cards to your project board by: -
      Dragging cards from the <strong>Triage</strong> section in the sidebar. -
      Typing the issue or pull request URL in a card. - Searching for issues or
      pull requests in the project board search sidebar.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can put a maximum of 2,500 cards into each project column. If a column
      has reached the maximum number of cards, no cards can be moved into that
      column.

      <strong>Note:</strong> You can also add notes to your project board to
      serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any
      repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or to add related
      information to your project board. For more information, see “<a

      <strong>Tips:</strong> - You can also add an issue or pull request by
      typing the URL in a card. - If you’re working on a specific feature, you
      can apply a label to each related issue or pull request for that feature,
      and then easily add cards to your project board by searching for the label
      name. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests"
        >Apply labels to issues and pull requests</a

      {% endtip %} 4. From the filtered list of issues and pull requests, drag
      the card you’d like to add to your project board and drop it in the

      shortcuts. {% data
