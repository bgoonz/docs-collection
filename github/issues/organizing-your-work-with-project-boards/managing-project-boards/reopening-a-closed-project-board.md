When you close a project board, any workflow automation that was configured for the project board will pause by default. For more information, see "[Closing a project board](/articles/closing-a-project-board)."

When you reopen a project board, you have the option to *sync* automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the board.

1. Navigate to the project board you want to reopen.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
3. Choose whether to sync automation for your project board or reopen your project board without syncing.
    - To reopen your project board and sync automation, click **Reopen and sync project**.

    - To reopen your project board without syncing automation, using the reopen drop-down menu, click **Reopen only**. Then, click **Reopen only**.
