Anyone with write permissions to a project board can link repositories owned by that organization or user account to the project board. For more information, see "[Project board permissions for an organization](/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization/)" or "[Permission levels for user-owned project boards](/articles/permission-levels-for-user-owned-project-boards/)."

{% data reusables.project-management.link-repos-to-project-board %} You can add issues and pull requests from any unlinked repositories by typing the issue or pull request URL in a card. For more information, see "[Adding issues and pull requests to a project board](/articles/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board)."

1. Navigate to the project board where you want to link a repository.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}

{% note %}

**Note:** In order to link a repository to your organization or user owned project board the repository needs to have issues enabled. That is, the repository has an "Issues" tab (in forked repositories issues are disabled by default).  For information on how to enable or disable issues for a repository, see "[Disabling issues for a repository](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/disabling-issues)."
