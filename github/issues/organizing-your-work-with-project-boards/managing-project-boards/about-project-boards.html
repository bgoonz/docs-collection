    <p>
      Project boards are made up of issues, pull requests, and notes that are
      categorized as cards in columns of your choosing. You can drag and drop or
      use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards within a column, move cards from
      column to column, and change the order of columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project board cards contain relevant metadata for issues and pull
      requests, like labels, assignees, the status, and who opened it. {% data
      reusables.project-management.edit-in-project %}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create notes within columns to serve as task reminders, references
      to issues and pull requests from any repository on {% data
      variables.product.product_name %}, or to add information related to the
      project board. You can create a reference card for another project board
      by adding a link to a note. If the note isn’t sufficient for your needs,
      you can convert it to an issue. For more information on converting project
      board notes to issues, see “<a
        href="/articles/adding-notes-to-a-project-board"
        >Adding notes to a project board</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>Types of project boards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User-owned project boards</strong> can contain issues and pull
        requests from any personal repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organization-wide project boards</strong> can contain issues and
        pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization. {%
        data reusables.project-management.link-repos-to-project-board %} For
        more information, see “<a
          href="/articles/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board"
          >Linking a repository to a project board</a
        >.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repository project boards</strong> are scoped to issues and pull
        requests within a single repository. They can also include notes that
        reference issues and pull requests in other repositories.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="creating-and-viewing-project-boards">
      Creating and viewing project boards
    </h2>
    <p>
      To create a project board for your organization, you must be an
      organization member. Organization owners and people with project board
      admin permissions can customize access to the project board.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an organization-owned project board includes issues or pull requests
      from a repository that you don’t have permission to view, the card will be
      redacted. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization"
        >Project board permissions for an organization</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The activity view shows the project board’s recent history, such as cards
      someone created or moved between columns. To access the activity view,
      click <strong>Menu</strong> and scroll down.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find specific cards on a project board or view a subset of the cards,
      you can filter project board cards. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/filtering-cards-on-a-project-board"
        >Filtering cards on a project board</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify your workflow and keep completed tasks off your project board,
      you can archive cards. For more information, see “<a
        href="/articles/archiving-cards-on-a-project-board"
        >Archiving cards on a project board</a
      >.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve completed all of your project board tasks or no longer need to
      use your project board, you can close the project board. For more
      information, see “<a href="/articles/closing-a-project-board"
        >Closing a project board</a
      >.”

    <h2 id="templates-for-project-boards">Templates for project boards</h2>
    <p>
      You can use templates to quickly set up a new project board. When you use
      a template to create a project board, your new board will include columns
      as well as cards with tips for using project boards. You can also choose a
      template with automation already configured.
