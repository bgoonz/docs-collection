**Tip**: If you'd like to retain access to a completed or unneeded project board without losing access to its contents, you can [close the project board](/articles/closing-a-project-board) instead of deleting it.

{% endtip %}

1. Navigate to the project board you want to delete.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
{% data reusables.project-management.click-edit-sidebar-menu-project-board %}
4. Click **Delete project**.
