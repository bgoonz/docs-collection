Copying a project board allows you to reuse a project board's title, description, and automation configuration. You can copy project boards to eliminate the manual process of creating new project boards for similar workflows.

You must have read access to a project board to copy it to a repository or organization where you have write access.

When you copy a project board to an organization, the project board's visibility will default to private, with an option to change the visibility. For more information, see "[Changing project board visibility](/articles/changing-project-board-visibility/)."

A project board's automation is also enabled by default. For more information, see "[About automation for project boards](/articles/about-automation-for-project-boards/)."

1. Navigate to the project board you want to copy.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
3. Click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}, then click **Copy**.
