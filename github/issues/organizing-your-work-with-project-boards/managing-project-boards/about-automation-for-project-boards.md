{% data reusables.project-management.automate-project-board-permissions %}  For more information, see "[Project board permissions for an organization](/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

You can automate actions based on triggering events for project board columns. This eliminates some of the manual tasks in managing a project board. For example, you can configure a "To do" column, where any new issues or pull requests you add to a project board are automatically moved to the configured column. For more information, see "[Configuring automation for project boards](/articles/configuring-automation-for-project-boards)."  

{% data reusables.project-management.use-automated-template %}

{% data reusables.project-management.copy-project-boards %}

Project board automation can also help teams develop a shared understanding of a project board's purpose and the team's development process by creating a standard workflow for certain actions.

{% data reusables.project-management.resync-automation %}

## Project progress tracking

You can track the progress on your project board. Cards in the "To do", "In progress", or "Done" columns count toward the overall project progress. {% data reusables.project-management.project-progress-locations %}

For more information, see "[Tracking progress on your project board](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-progress-on-your-project-board)."
