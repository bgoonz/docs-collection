{% tip %}

**Tips:**

- If you'd rather filter issues and pull requests using the Search bar, you can use the milestone search syntax. For a milestone called My Milestone, the search syntax would be: `milestone:"My Milestone"`.
- To clear your filter selection, click **Clear current search query, filters, and sorts**.
-  You can also filter issues or pull requests using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see "[`gh issue list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_list)" or "[`gh pr list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_list)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} documentation.
