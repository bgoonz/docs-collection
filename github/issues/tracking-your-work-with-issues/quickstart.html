</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide demonstrates how to use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_issues %} to plan and track a piece of work. In this guide, you will create a new issue and add a task list to track sub-tasks. You’ll also learn how to add labels, milestones, assignees, and projects to communicate metadata about your issue.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To create an issue, you need a repository. You can use an existing repository that you have write access to, or you can create a new repository. The repository must have issues enabled. For more information about creating a repository, see “<a href="/articles/creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new repository</a>.” For more information about enabling issues if they are disabled in your repository, see “<a href="/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-issues">Disabling issues</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="opening-a-blank-issue">Opening a blank issue</h2>
<p>First, create an issue. There are multiple ways to create an issue; you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. This example will use the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} UI. For more information about other ways to create an issue, see “<a href="/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">Creating an issue</a>.”</p>
<p>{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} {% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-issues %} {% data reusables.repositories.new_issue %} 1. In this example, we will start with a blank issue. Your repository may use issue templates{% ifversion fpt %} and issue forms{% endif %} to encourage contributors to provide specific information. If your repository uses issue templates, {% ifversion fpt or ghes %}click <strong>Open a blank issue</strong>{% else %}click <strong>Open a regular issue.</strong>{% endif %}.</p>

<h2 id="filling-in-information">Filling in information</h2>
<p>Give your issue a descriptive title. The title should convey at a glance what the issue is about.</p>
<p>Add a description that explains the purpose of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue. For example, if this is a bug report, describe the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected result, and the actual result.</p>
<p>You can use markdown to add formatting, links, emojis, and more. For more information, see “<a href="/github/writing-on-github">Writing on GitHub</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-task-list">Adding a task list</h2>
<p>It can be helpful to break large issues into smaller tasks, or to track multiple related issues in a single larger issue. Add a task list to your issue by prefacing list items with <code>[ ]</code>. Reference existing issues by issue number or URL. You can use plain text to track tasks that don’t have a corresponding issue and convert them to issues later. For more information, see “<a href="/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists">About task lists</a>.”</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="adding-labels">Adding labels</h2>
<p>Add a label to categorize your issue. For example, you might use a <code>bug</code> label and a <code>good first issue</code> label to indicate that an issue is a bug that a first-time contributor could pick up. Users can filter issues by label to find all issues that have a specific label.</p>
<p>You can use the default labels, or you can create a new label. For more information, see “<a href="/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels">Managing labels</a>.”</p>

<img src="/assets/images/help/issues/issue-with-label.png" alt="issue with labels" /><figcaption>issue with labels</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="adding-milestones">Adding milestones</h2>
<p>You can add a milestone to track the issue as part of a date based target. A milestone will show the progress of the issues as the target date approaches. For more information, see “<a href="/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones">About milestones</a>.”</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="assigning-the-issue">Assigning the issue</h2>
<p>To communicate responsibility, you can assign the issue to a member of your organization. For more information, see “<a href="/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users">Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users</a>.”</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="adding-the-issue-to-a-project">Adding the issue to a project</h2>
<p>You can add the issue to an existing project. {% ifversion fpt %}If you are using projects (beta), you can also populate metadata for the project. {% endif %} For more information about projects, see {% ifversion fpt %}“<a href="/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects">About projects (beta)</a>” and {% endif %}“<a href="/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards">Organizing your work with project boards</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-your-issue">Submitting your issue</h2>
<p>Click <strong>Submit new issue</strong> to create your issue. You can edit any of the above fields after creating the issue. Your issue has a unique URL that you can share with team members, or reference in other issues or pull requests.</p>
<h2 id="communicating">Communicating</h2>
<p>After your issue is created, continue the conversation by adding comments to the issue. You can <span class="citation" data-cites="mention">@mention</span> collaborators or teams to draw their attention to a comment. To link related issues in the same repository, you can type <code>#</code> followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link. For more information, see “<a href="/github/writing-on-github">Writing on GitHub</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>You can use issues for a wide range of purposes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking ideas</li>
<li>Collecting feedback</li>
<li>Planning tasks</li>
<li>Reporting bugs</li>
</ul>
