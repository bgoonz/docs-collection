## Integrated with GitHub

Issues let you track your work on {% data variables.product.company_short %}, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes.

## Quickly create issues

Issues can be created in a variety of ways, so you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. For example, you can create an issue from a repository,{% ifversion fpt %} an item in a task list,{% endif %} a note in a project, a comment in an issue or pull request, a specific line of code, or a URL query. You can also create an issue from your platform of choice: through the web UI, {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}, GraphQL and REST APIs, or {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. For more information, see "[Creating an issue](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/creating-an-issue)."

## Track work

You can organize and prioritize issues with projects. {% ifversion fpt %}To track issues as part of a larger issue, you can use task lists.{% endif %} To categorize related issues, you can use labels and milestones.

For more information about projects, see {% ifversion fpt %}"[About projects (beta)](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects)" and {% endif %}"[Organizing your work with project boards](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards)." {% ifversion fpt %}For more information about task lists, see "[About task lists](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/about-task-lists)." {% endif %}For more information about labels and milestones, see "[Using labels and milestones to track work](/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work)."

## Stay up to date

To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can subscribe to an issue to receive notifications about the latest comments. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard. For more information, see {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghae %}"[About notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications){% else %}"[About notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications){% endif %}" and "[About your personal dashboard](/articles/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

## Community management

To help contributors open meaningful issues that provide the information that you need, you can use {% ifversion fpt %}issue forms and {% endif %}issue templates. For more information, see "[Using templates to encourage useful issues and pull requests](/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests)."

{% ifversion fpt %}To maintain a healthy community, you can report comments that violate {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s [Community Guidelines](/articles/github-community-guidelines). For more information, see "[Reporting abuse or spam](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam)."{% endif %}

## Efficient communication

You can @mention collaborators who have access to your repository in an issue to draw their attention to a comment. To link related issues in the same repository, you can type `#` followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link. To communicate responsibility, you can assign issues. If you find yourself frequently typing the same comment, you can use saved replies.
{% ifversion fpt %} For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" and "[Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)."

## Comparing issues and discussions

Some conversations are more suitable for {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}. {% data reusables.discussions.you-can-use-discussions %} For guidance on when to use an issue or a discussion, see "[Communicating on GitHub](/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/communicating-on-github)."

When a conversation in an issue is better suited for a discussion, you can convert the issue to a discussion.
