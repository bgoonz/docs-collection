    <p>
      Issues let you track your work on {% data variables.product.company_short
      %}, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue
      or pull request, the issue’s timeline reflects the cross-reference so that
      you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress,
      you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the
      linked issue automatically closes.
    </p>
    <h2 id="quickly-create-issues">Quickly create issues</h2>
    <p>
      Issues can be created in a variety of ways, so you can choose the most
      convenient method for your workflow. For example, you can create an issue
      from a repository,{% ifversion fpt %} an item in a task list,{% endif %} a
      note in a project, a comment in an issue or pull request, a specific line
      of code, or a URL query. You can also create an issue from your platform
      of choice: through the web UI, {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop
      %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}, GraphQL and REST APIs, or
      {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. For more information, see

      <code>#</code> followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the
      issue that you want to link. To communicate responsibility, you can assign
      issues. If you find yourself frequently typing the same comment, you can
