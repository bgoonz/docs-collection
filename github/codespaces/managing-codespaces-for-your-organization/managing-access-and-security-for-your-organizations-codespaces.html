      Organization owners can manage which repositories a codespace can access.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, a codespace can only access the repository where it was
      created. When you enable access and security for a repository owned by
      your organization, any codespaces that are created for that repository
      will also have read and write permissions to all other repositories the
      organization owns and the codespace creator has permissions to access. If
      you want to restrict the repositories a codespace can access, you can
      limit to it to either the repository where the codespace was created, or
      to specific repositories. You should only enable access and security for
      repositories you trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      To manage which users in your organization can use {% data
      variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}, see “<a
        href="/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-user-permissions-for-your-organization"
        >Managing user permissions for your organization</a
      >.”

    <p>
      {% data reusables.profile.access_org %} {% data
      reusables.profile.org_settings %} {% data
      reusables.organizations.click-codespaces %} 1. Under “Access and
      security”, select the setting you want for your organization.

      1. If you chose “Selected repositories”, select the drop-down menu, then
      click a repository to allow the repository’s codespaces to access other
      repositories owned by your organization. Repeat for all repositories whose
      codespaces you want to access other repositories.
