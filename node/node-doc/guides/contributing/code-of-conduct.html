    <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      The Node.js project has a
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
        >Code of Conduct</a
      >
      that <em>all</em> contributors are expected to follow. This code describes
      the <em>minimum</em> behavior expectations for all contributors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a contributor to Node.js, how you choose to act and interact towards
      your fellow contributors, as well as to the community, will reflect back
      not only on yourself but on the project as a whole. The Code of Conduct is
      designed and intended, above all else, to help establish a culture within
      the project that allows anyone and everyone who wants to contribute to
      feel safe doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should any individual act in any way that is considered in violation of
      the
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
        >Code of Conduct</a
      >, corrective actions will be taken. It is possible, however, for any
      individual to <em>act</em> in such a manner that is not in violation of
      the strict letter of the Code of Conduct guidelines while still going
      completely against the spirit of what that Code is intended to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open, diverse, and inclusive communities live and die on the basis of
      trust. Contributors can disagree with one another so long as they trust
      that those disagreements are in good faith and everyone is working towards
      a common goal.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bad-actors">Bad actors</h2>
    <p>
      All contributors to Node.js tacitly agree to abide by both the letter and
      spirit of the
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
        >Code of Conduct</a
      >. Failure, or unwillingness, to do so will result in contributions being
      respectfully declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>bad actor</em> is someone who repeatedly violates the spirit of the
      Code of Conduct through failure to regulate how they interact with others.
      In doing so, bad actors alienate other contributors, discourage
      collaboration, and generally reflect poorly on the project as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a bad actor may be intentional or unintentional. Typically,
      unintentional bad behavior can be easily corrected by being quick to
      apologize and correct course
      <em>even if you are not entirely convinced you need to</em>. Giving other
      contributors the benefit of the doubt and having a sincere willingness to
      admit that you <em>might</em> be wrong is critical for any successful open
      collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>Donâ€™t be a bad actor.</p>
