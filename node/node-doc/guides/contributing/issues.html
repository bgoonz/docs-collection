    <h2 id="asking-for-general-help">Asking for general help</h2>
    <p>
      Because the level of activity in the <code>nodejs/node</code> repository
      is so high, questions or requests for general help using Node.js should be
      directed at the
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues">Node.js help repository</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="discussing-non-technical-topics">
      Discussing non-technical topics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Discussion of non-technical topics (such as intellectual property and
      trademark) should be directed to the
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues"
        >Technical Steering Committee (TSC) repository</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="submitting-a-bug-report">Submitting a bug report</h2>
    <p>
      When opening a new issue in the <code>nodejs/node</code> issue tracker,
      users will be presented with a choice of issue templates. If you believe
      that you have uncovered a bug in Node.js, please fill out the
      <code>Bug Report</code> template to the best of your ability. Do not worry
      if you cannot answer every detail; just fill in what you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two most important pieces of information we need in order to properly
      evaluate the report is a description of the behavior you are seeing and a
      simple test case we can use to recreate the problem on our own. If we
      cannot recreate the issue, it becomes impossible for us to fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to rule out the possibility of bugs introduced by userland code,
      test cases should be limited, as much as possible, to using
      <em>only</em> Node.js APIs. If the bug occurs only when you’re using a
      specific userland module, there is a very good chance that either (a) the
      module has a bug or (b) something in Node.js changed that broke the
      module.

    <h2 id="triaging-a-bug-report">Triaging a bug report</h2>
    <p>
      Once an issue has been opened, it is common for there to be discussion
      around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue,
      including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This
      discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and
      professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of helping with triaging issues (in core and help repos) is
      to help reduce the issue backlog and keep the issue tracker healthy, while
      enabling newcomers another meaningful way to get engaged and contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone with a reasonable understanding of Node.js programming and the
      project’s GitHub organization plus a few contributions to the project
      (commenting on issues or PRs) can apply for and become a triager. Open a
      PR on the README.md of this project with: i) a request to be added as a
      triager, ii) the motivation for becoming a triager, and iii) agreement on
      reading, understanding, and adhering to the project’s
      <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
        >Code Of Conduct</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triage role enables the ability to carry out the most common triage
      activities, such as applying labels and closing/reopening/assigning
      issues. For more information on the roles and permissions, see
      <a
