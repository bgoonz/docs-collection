# Offboarding

This document is a checklist of things to do when a collaborator becomes emeritus or leaves the project.

- Remove the collaborator from the <span class="citation" data-cites="nodejs/collaborators">@nodejs/collaborators</span> team.
- Open a fast-track pull request to move the collaborator to the collaborator emeriti list in README.md.
- Determine what GitHub teams the collaborator belongs to. In consultation with the collaborator, determine which of those teams they should be removed from.
  - Some teams may also require a pull request to remove the collaborator from a team listing. For example, if someone is removed from <span class="citation" data-cites="nodejs/build">@nodejs/build</span>, they should also be removed from the Build WG README.md file in the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/build" class="uri">https://github.com/nodejs/build</a> repository.
