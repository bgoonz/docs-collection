# Community

## Technical committee

The Express technical committee meets online every two weeks (as needed) to discuss development and maintenance of Express, and other issues relevant to the Express project. Each meeting is typically announced in an [expressjs/discussions issue](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/issues) with a link to join or view the meeting, which is open to all observers.

The meetings are recorded; for a list of the recordings, see the [Express.js YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjxjAeH6TRik9Iwy5nXw7g).

## Express is made of many modules

Our vibrant community has created a large variety of extensions, [middleware modules](/%7B%7B%20page.lang%20%7D%7D/resources/middleware.html) and [higher-level frameworks](frameworks.html).

Additionally, the Express community maintains modules in these two GitHub orgs:

- [jshttp](https://jshttp.github.io/) modules providing useful utility functions; see [Utility modules](/%7B%7B%20page.lang%20%7D%7D/resources/utils.html).
- [pillarjs](https://pillarjs.github.io/): low-level modules that Express uses internally.

To keep up with what is going on in the whole community, check out the [ExpressJS StatusBoard](https://expressjs.github.com/statusboard).
