    <p>
      The Express technical committee consists of active project members, and
      guides development and maintenance of the Express project. For more

    <!-- SRC: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/expressjs/express/master/Contributing.md -->
    <p>The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourages new contributions.</li>
      <li>Encourages contributors to remain involved.</li>
      <li>Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.</li>
      <li>
        Creates a transparent decision making process that makes it clear how
        contributors can be involved in decision making.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <strong>Contributor</strong> is any individual creating or commenting
        on an issue or pull request.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>Committer</strong> is a subset of contributors who have been
        given write access to the repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>TC (Technical Committee)</strong> is a group of committers
        representing the required technical expertise to resolve rare disputes.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>Triager</strong> is a subset of contributors who have been
        given triage access to the repository.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="logging-issues">Logging Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt,
      log an issue, and any additional policies about what to include will be
      provided in the responses. The only exception is security disclosures
      which should be sent privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional
      clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be courteous and respectful. Every participant is expected to
      follow the project’s Code of Conduct.
    </p>
    <h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
    <p>
      Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests.
      This applies to all changes to documentation, code, binary files, etc.
      Even long term committers and TC members must use pull requests.
    </p>
    <p>No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.</p>
    <p>
      For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36
      hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review.
      Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods
      to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in
      the discussion and review process if they wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer
      has an objection. During a review, committers may also request that a
      specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a
      “LGTM” before the PR can be merged. There is no additional “sign off”
      process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers
      are addressed it can be landed by any committer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another
      committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by
      way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on
      the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how
      to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the
      TC. TC members should regularly discuss pending contributions in order to
      find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be
      brought to the TC for resolution and that discussion and compromise among
      committers be the default resolution mechanism.
    </p>
    <h3 id="becoming-a-triager">Becoming a Triager</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone can become a triager! Read more about the process of being a
      triager in <a href="Triager-Guide.md">the triage process document</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/new"
        >Open an issue in <code>expressjs/express</code> repo</a
      >
      to request the triage role. State that you have read and agree to the
      <a href="Code-Of-Conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a> and details of the role.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example issue content you can copy and paste:</p>
    <pre><code>Title: Request triager role for &lt;your GitHub username&gt;

I have read and understood the project&#39;s Code of Conduct.
I also have read and understood the process and best practices around Express triaging.

I request for a triager role for the following GitHub organizations:

jshttp
pillarjs
express</code></pre>
    <p>
      Once you have opened your issue, a member of the TC will add you to the
      <code>triage</code> team in the organizations requested. They will then
      close the issue.
    </p>
    <p>Happy triaging!</p>
    <h3 id="becoming-a-committer">Becoming a Committer</h3>
    <p>
      All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded
      in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to
      the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull
      requests, go through proper review, and have other committers merge their
      pull requests.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tc-process">TC Process</h3>
    <p>
      The TC uses a “consensus seeking” process for issues that are escalated to
      the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections
      among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections
      then a majority wins vote is called. It is also expected that the majority
      of decisions made by the TC are via a consensus seeking process and that
      voting is only used as a last-resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions
      on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a
      meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its agenda during that
      meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the
      committers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate
      another committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking
      process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do
      not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other
      members are expected to resign.

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/new"
          >Create an issue</a
        >
        for the bug you want to fix or the feature that you want to add.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create your own
        <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">fork</a> on GitHub, then
        checkout your fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write your code in your local copy. It’s good practice to create a
        branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
      </li>
      <li>
        To run the test suite, first install the dependencies by running
        <code>npm install</code>, then run <code>npm test</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure your code is linted by running <code>npm run lint</code> – fix
        any issue you see listed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the tests pass, you can commit your changes to your fork and then
        create a pull request from there. Make sure to reference your issue from
        the pull request comments by including the issue number
        e.g. <code>#123</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="issues-which-are-questions">Issues which are questions</h3>
    <p>
      We will typically close any vague issues or questions that are specific to
      some app you are writing. Please double check the docs and other
      references before being trigger happy with posting a question issue.
    </p>
    <p>Things that will help get your question issue looked at:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full and runnable JS code.</li>
      <li>Clear description of the problem or unexpected behavior.</li>
      <li>Clear description of the expected result.</li>
      <li>Steps you have taken to debug it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you post a question and do not outline the above items or make it easy
      for us to understand and reproduce your issue, it will be closed.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.</li>
      <li>Audit code to find any potential similar problems.</li>
      <li>
        Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will
