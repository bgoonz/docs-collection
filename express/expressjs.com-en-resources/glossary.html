    <h3 id="application">application</h3>
    <p>
      In general, one or more programs that are designed to carry out operations
      for a specific purpose. In the context of Express, a program that uses the
      Express API running on the Node.js platform. Might also refer to an
      <a href="/%7B%7B%20page.lang%20%7D%7D/api.html#express">app object</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="api">API</h3>
    <p>
      Application programming interface. Spell out the abbreviation when it is
      first used.
    </p>
    <h3 id="express">Express</h3>
    <p>
      A fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js applications.
      In general, “Express” is preferred to “Express.js,” though the latter is
      acceptable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="libuv">libuv</h3>
    <p>
      A multi-platform support library which focuses on asynchronous I/O,
      primarily developed for use by Node.js.
    </p>
    <h3 id="middleware">middleware</h3>
    <p>
      A function that is invoked by the Express routing layer before the final
      request handler, and thus sits in the middle between a raw request and the
      final intended route. A few fine points of terminology around middleware:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>var foo = require('middleware')</code> is called
        <em>requiring</em> or <em>using</em> a Node.js module. Then the
        statement <code>var mw = foo()</code> typically returns the middleware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>app.use(mw)</code> is called
        <em>adding the middleware to the global processing stack</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>app.get('/foo', mw, function (req, res) { ... })</code> is called
        <em>adding the middleware to the “GET /foo” processing stack</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="node.js">Node.js</h3>
    <p>
      A software platform that is used to build scalable network applications.
      Node.js uses JavaScript as its scripting language, and achieves high
      throughput via non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop. See
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs.org</a>.
      <strong>Usage note</strong>: Initially, “Node.js,” thereafter “Node”.
    </p>
    <h3 id="open-source-open-source">open-source, open source</h3>
    <p>
      When used as an adjective, hyphenate; for example: “This is open-source
      software.” See
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"
        >Open-source software on Wikipedia</a
      >. Note: Although it is common not to hyphenate this term, we are using
      the standard English rules for hyphenating a compound adjective.
    </p>
    <h3 id="request">request</h3>
    <p>
      An HTTP request. A client submits an HTTP request message to a server,
      which returns a response. The request must use one of several
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods"
        >request methods</a
      >
      such as GET, POST, and so on.
    </p>
    <h3 id="response">response</h3>
    <p>
      An HTTP response. A server returns an HTTP response message to the client.
      The response contains completion status information about the request and
      might also contain requested content in its message body.
    </p>
    <h3 id="route">route</h3>
    <p>
      Part of a URL that identifies a resource. For example, in
      <code>http://foo.com/products/id</code>, “/products/id” is the route.
    </p>
    <h3 id="router">router</h3>
    <p>
      See <a href="/%7B%7B%20page.lang%20%7D%7D/api.html#router">router</a> in
      the API reference.
