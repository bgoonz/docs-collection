    <p>
      When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a
      <em>process manager</em> to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Restart the app automatically if it crashes.</li>
      <li>Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.</li>
      <li>Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.</li>
      <li>Control clustering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a
      “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high
      availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js
      applications are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        **<a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever">Forever</a>{:
        target="_blank"}**: A simple command-line interface tool to ensure that
        a script runs continuously (forever). Forever’s simple interface makes
        it ideal for running smaller deployments of Node.js apps and scripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        **<a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">PM2</a>{: target="_blank"}**:
        A production process manager for Node.js applications that has a
        built-in load balancer. PM2 enables you to keep applications alive
        forever, reloads them without downtime, helps you to manage application
        logging, monitoring, and clustering.
      </li>

          ><a href="http://strong-pm.io/"
            >StrongLoop Process Manager (Strong-PM)</a
          ></strong
        >: A production process manager for Node.js applications with built-in
        load balancing, monitoring, and multi-host deployment. Includes a CLI to
        build, package, and deploy Node.js applications to a local or remote
        system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SystemD</strong>: The default process manager on modern Linux
        distributions, that makes it simple to run a Node application as a
        service. For more information, see
