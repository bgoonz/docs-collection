    <p>
      Native modules are usually distributed as npm packages, except that on top
      of the usual JavaScript they will include some native code per platform.
      To understand more about npm packages you may find
      <a
        href="https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry"
        >this guide</a
      >
      useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get set up with the basic project structure for a native module we will
      use the community tool called
      <a href="https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob"
        >create-react-native-library</a
      >. You can go ahead further and dive deep into how that library works, but
      for our needs we will only execute the basic script:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>npx create-react-native-library react-native-awesome-module</code></pre>
    <p>
      Where <code>react-native-awesome-module</code> is the name you would like
      for the new module. After doing this you will navigate into
      <code>react-native-awesome-module</code> folder and bootstrap the example
      project by running:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>yarn</code></pre>
    <p>
      When the bootstrap is done, you will be able to start the example app by
      executing one of the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code># Android app
yarn example android
# iOS app
yarn example ios</code></pre>
    <p>
      When all steps above are done, you will be able to continue with
      <a href="native-modules-android">Android Native Modules</a> or
      <a href="native-modules-ios">iOS Native Modules</a> guides to add in some
      code.

        For a less opinionated setup, have a look at the third party tool
        <a href="https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module"
          >create-react-native-module</a
        >.
