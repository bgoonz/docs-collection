      Use the built-in profiler to get detailed information about work done in
      the JavaScript thread and main thread side-by-side. Access it by selecting
      Perf Monitor from the Debug menu.

      For iOS, Instruments is an invaluable tool, and on Android you should
      learn to use
      <a href="profiling.md#profiling-android-ui-performance-with-systrace"
        ><code>systrace</code></a
      >.

      But first,
      <a href="performance.md#running-in-development-mode-devtrue"
        ><strong>make sure that Development Mode is OFF!</strong></a
      >
      You should see
      <code
        >__DEV__ === false, development-level warning are OFF, performance
        optimizations are ON</code
      >
      in your application logs.

      Another way to profile JavaScript is to use the Chrome profiler while
      debugging. This won’t give you accurate results as the code is running in
      Chrome but will give you a general idea of where bottlenecks might be. Run
      the profiler under Chrome’s <code>Performance</code> tab. A flame graph
      will appear under <code>User Timing</code>. To view more details in
      tabular format, click at the <code>Bottom Up</code> tab below and then
      select <code>DedicatedWorker Thread</code> at the top left menu.

      Profiling Android UI Performance with <code>systrace</code>

      Android supports 10k+ different phones and is generalized to support
      software rendering: the framework architecture and need to generalize
      across many hardware targets unfortunately means you get less for free
      relative to iOS. But sometimes, there are things you can improve – and
      many times it’s not native code’s fault at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step for debugging this jank is to answer the fundamental
      question of where your time is being spent during each 16ms frame. For
      that, we’ll be using a standard Android profiling tool called
      <code>systrace</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>systrace</code> is a standard Android marker-based profiling tool
      (and is installed when you install the Android platform-tools package).
      Profiled code blocks are surrounded by start/end markers which are then
      visualized in a colorful chart format. Both the Android SDK and React
      Native framework provide standard markers that you can visualize.
    </p>
    <h3 id="collecting-a-trace">1. Collecting a trace</h3>
    <p>
      First, connect a device that exhibits the stuttering you want to
      investigate to your computer via USB and get it to the point right before
      the navigation/animation you want to profile. Run <code>systrace</code> as
      follows:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>$ &lt;path_to_android_sdk&gt;/platform-tools/systrace/systrace.py --time=10 -o trace.html sched gfx view -a &lt;your_package_name&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>A quick breakdown of this command:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>time</code> is the length of time the trace will be collected in
        seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>sched</code>, <code>gfx</code>, and <code>view</code> are the
        android SDK tags (collections of markers) we care about:
        <code>sched</code> gives you information about what’s running on each
        core of your phone, <code>gfx</code> gives you graphics info such as
        frame boundaries, and <code>view</code> gives you information about
        measure, layout, and draw passes
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>-a &lt;your_package_name&gt;</code> enables app-specific markers,
        specifically the ones built into the React Native framework.
        <code>your_package_name</code> can be found in the
        <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> of your app and looks like
        <code>com.example.app</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once the trace starts collecting, perform the animation or interaction you
      care about. At the end of the trace, systrace will give you a link to the
      trace which you can open in your browser.
    </p>
    <h3 id="reading-the-trace">2. Reading the trace</h3>
    <p>
      After opening the trace in your browser (preferably Chrome), you should
      see something like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/SystraceExample.png" alt="Example" />
      <figcaption>Example</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>HINT</strong>: Use the WASD keys to strafe and zoom</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If your trace .html file isn’t opening correctly, check your browser
      console for the following:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/ObjectObserveError.png" alt="ObjectObserveError" />
      <figcaption>ObjectObserveError</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Since <code>Object.observe</code> was deprecated in recent browsers, you
      may have to open the file from the Google Chrome Tracing tool. You can do
      so by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening tab in chrome chrome://tracing</li>
      <li>Selecting load</li>
      <li>Selecting the html file generated from the previous command.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Enable VSync highlighting</strong></p>

        <figcaption>Enable VSync Highlighting</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        You should see zebra stripes as in the screenshot above. If you don’t,
        try profiling on a different device: Samsung has been known to have
        issues displaying vsyncs while the Nexus series is generally pretty
        reliable.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="find-your-process">3. Find your process</h3>
    <p>
      Scroll until you see (part of) the name of your package. In this case, I
      was profiling <code>com.facebook.adsmanager</code>, which shows up as
      <code>book.adsmanager</code> because of silly thread name limits in the
      kernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left side, you’ll see a set of threads which correspond to the
      timeline rows on the right. There are a few threads we care about for our
      purposes: the UI thread (which has your package name or the name UI
      Thread), <code>mqt_js</code>, and <code>mqt_native_modules</code>. If
      you’re running on Android 5+, we also care about the Render Thread.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>UI Thread.</strong> This is where standard android
          measure/layout/draw happens. The thread name on the right will be your
          package name (in my case book.adsmanager) or UI Thread. The events
          that you see on this thread should look something like this and have
          to do with <code>Choreographer</code>, <code>traversals</code>, and
          <code>DispatchUI</code>:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img

          <figcaption>UI Thread Example</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>JS Thread.</strong> This is where JavaScript is executed. The
          thread name will be either <code>mqt_js</code> or
          <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> depending on how cooperative the kernel on
          your device is being. To identify it if it doesn’t have a name, look
          for things like <code>JSCall</code>,
          <code>Bridge.executeJSCall</code>, etc:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/docs/assets/SystraceJSThreadExample.png"

          />
          <figcaption>JS Thread Example</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Native Modules Thread.</strong> This is where native module
          calls (e.g. the <code>UIManager</code>) are executed. The thread name
          will be either <code>mqt_native_modules</code> or
          <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>. To identify it in the latter case, look for
          things like <code>NativeCall</code>,
          <code>callJavaModuleMethod</code>, and <code>onBatchComplete</code>:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Bonus: Render Thread.</strong> If you’re using Android L (5.0)
          and up, you will also have a render thread in your application. This
          thread generates the actual OpenGL commands used to draw your UI. The
          thread name will be either <code>RenderThread</code> or
          <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>. To identify it in the latter case, look for
          things like <code>DrawFrame</code> and <code>queueBuffer</code>:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/docs/assets/SystraceRenderThreadExample.png"
            alt="Render Thread Example"
          />
          <figcaption>Render Thread Example</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="identifying-a-culprit">Identifying a culprit</h2>
    <p>A smooth animation should look something like the following:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/SystraceWellBehaved.png" alt="Smooth Animation" />
      <figcaption>Smooth Animation</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Each change in color is a frame – remember that in order to display a
      frame, all our UI work needs to be done by the end of that 16ms period.
      Notice that no thread is working close to the frame boundary. An
      application rendering like this is rendering at 60 FPS.
    </p>
    <p>If you noticed chop, however, you might see something like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/docs/assets/SystraceBadJS.png"
        alt="Choppy Animation from JS"
      />
      <figcaption>Choppy Animation from JS</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Notice that the JS thread is executing almost all the time, and across
      frame boundaries! This app is not rendering at 60 FPS. In this case,
      <strong>the problem lies in JS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>You might also see something like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/docs/assets/SystraceBadUI.png"
        alt="Choppy Animation from UI"
      />
      <figcaption>Choppy Animation from UI</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this case, the UI and render threads are the ones that have work
      crossing frame boundaries. The UI that we’re trying to render on each
      frame is requiring too much work to be done. In this case,
      <strong>the problem lies in the native views being rendered</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, you’ll have some very helpful information to inform your
      next steps.
    </p>
    <h2 id="resolving-javascript-issues">Resolving JavaScript issues</h2>
    <p>
      If you identified a JS problem, look for clues in the specific JS that
      you’re executing. In the scenario above, we see
      <code>RCTEventEmitter</code> being called multiple times per frame. Here’s
      a zoom-in of the JS thread from the trace above:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/SystraceBadJS2.png" alt="Too much JS" />
      <figcaption>Too much JS</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This doesn’t seem right. Why is it being called so often? Are they
      actually different events? The answers to these questions will probably
      depend on your product code. And many times, you’ll want to look into
      <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate"
        >shouldComponentUpdate</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="resolving-native-ui-issues">Resolving native UI Issues</h2>
    <p>
      If you identified a native UI problem, there are usually two scenarios:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        the UI you’re trying to draw each frame involves too much work on the
        GPU, or
      </li>
      <li>
        You’re constructing new UI during the animation/interaction
        (e.g. loading in new content during a scroll).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="too-much-gpu-work">Too much GPU work</h3>
    <p>
      In the first scenario, you’ll see a trace that has the UI thread and/or
      Render Thread looking like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/SystraceBadUI.png" alt="Overloaded GPU" />
      <figcaption>Overloaded GPU</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Notice the long amount of time spent in <code>DrawFrame</code> that
      crosses frame boundaries. This is time spent waiting for the GPU to drain
      its command buffer from the previous frame.
    </p>
    <p>To mitigate this, you should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        investigate using <code>renderToHardwareTextureAndroid</code> for
        complex, static content that is being animated/transformed (e.g. the
        <code>Navigator</code> slide/alpha animations)
      </li>
      <li>
        make sure that you are <strong>not</strong> using
        <code>needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing</code>, which is disabled by
        default, as it greatly increases the per-frame load on the GPU in most
        cases.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If these don’t help and you want to dig deeper into what the GPU is
      actually doing, you can check out
      <a href="http://www.androiddocs.com/tools/help/gltracer.html"
        >Tracer for OpenGL ES</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="creating-new-views-on-the-ui-thread">
      Creating new views on the UI thread
    </h3>
    <p>In the second scenario, you’ll see something more like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/docs/assets/SystraceBadCreateUI.png" alt="Creating Views" />
      <figcaption>Creating Views</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Notice that first the JS thread thinks for a bit, then you see some work
      done on the native modules thread, followed by an expensive traversal on
      the UI thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      There isn’t a quick way to mitigate this unless you’re able to postpone
      creating new UI until after the interaction, or you are able to simplify
      the UI you’re creating. The react native team is working on an
      infrastructure level solution for this that will allow new UI to be
      created and configured off the main thread, allowing the interaction to
      continue smoothly.
