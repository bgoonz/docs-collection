      Sometimes a React Native app needs to access a native platform API that is
      not available by default in JavaScript, for example the native APIs to
      access Apple or Google Pay. Maybe you want to reuse some existing
      Objective-C, Swift, Java or C++ libraries without having to reimplement it
      in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code for
      things like image processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NativeModule system exposes instances of Java/Objective-C/C++ (native)
      classes to JavaScript (JS) as JS objects, thereby allowing you to execute
      arbitrary native code from within JS. While we don’t expect this feature
      to be part of the usual development process, it is essential that it
      exists. If React Native doesn’t export a native API that your JS app needs
      you should be able to export it yourself!

    <p>
      There are two ways to write a native module for your React Native
      application:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Directly within your React Native application’s iOS/Android projects
      </li>
      <li>
        As a NPM package that can be installed as a dependency by your/other
        React Native applications
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This guide will first walk you through implementing a native module
      directly within a React Native application. However the native module you
      build in the following guide can be distributed as an NPM package. Check
      out the
      <a href="native-modules-setup"
        >Setting Up a Native Module as a NPM Package</a
      >
      guide if you are interested in doing so.
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      In the following sections we will walk you through guides on how to build
      a native module directly within a React Native application. As a
      prerequisite, you will need a React Native application to work within. You
      can follow the steps <a href="getting-started">here</a> to setup a React
      Native application if you do not already have one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine that you want to access the iOS/Android native calendar APIs from
      JavaScript within a React Native application in order to create calendar
      events. React Native does not expose a JavaScript API to communicate with
      the native calendar libraries. However, through native modules, you can
      write native code that communicates with native calendar APIs. Then you
      can invoke that native code through JavaScript in your React Native
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following sections you will create such a Calendar native module
      for both <a href="native-modules-android">Android</a> and
      <a href="native-modules-ios">iOS</a>.
