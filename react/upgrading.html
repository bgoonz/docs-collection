      Upgrading to new versions of React Native will give you access to more
      APIs, views, developer tools and other goodies. Upgrading requires a small
      amount of effort, but we try to make it straightforward for you.
    </p>
    <h2 id="expo-projects">Expo projects</h2>
    <p>
      Upgrading your Expo project to a new version of React Native requires
      updating the <code>react-native</code>, <code>react</code>, and
      <code>expo</code> package versions in your <code>package.json</code> file.
      Please refer to
      <a href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/#sdk-version"
        >this list</a
      >
      to find out what versions are supported. You will also need to set the
      correct <code>sdkVersion</code> in your <code>app.json</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the
      <a
        href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough"
        >Upgrading Expo SDK Walkthrough</a
      >
      for up-to-date information about upgrading your project.

    <h2 id="react-native-projects">React Native projects</h2>
    <p>
      Because typical React Native projects are essentially made up of an
      Android project, an iOS project, and a JavaScript project, upgrading can
      be rather tricky. There‚Äôs currently two ways for upgrading your React
      Native project: by using
      <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli"
        >React Native CLI</a
      >
      or manually with
      <a href="https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/"
        >Upgrade Helper</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="react-native-cli">React Native CLI</h3>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli"
        >React Native CLI</a
      >
      comes with <code>upgrade</code> command that provides a one-step operation
      to upgrade the source files with a minimum of conflicts, it internally
      uses
      <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge"
        >rn-diff-purge</a
      >
      project to find out which files need to be created, removed or modified.
    </p>
    <h4 id="run-the-upgrade-command">
      1. Run the <code>upgrade</code> command
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The <code>upgrade</code> command works on top of Git by using
        <code>git apply</code> with 3-way merge, therefore it‚Äôs required to use
        Git in order for this to work, if you don‚Äôt use Git but still want to
        use this solution then you can check out how to do it in the
        <a href="#i-want-to-upgrade-with-react-native-cli-but-i-dont-use-git"
          >Troubleshooting</a
        >
        section.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Run the following command to start the process of upgrading to the latest
      version:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>npx react-native upgrade</code></pre>
    <p>
      You may specify a React Native version by passing an argument, e.g.¬†to
      upgrade to <code>0.61.0-rc.0</code> run:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>npx react-native upgrade 0.61.0-rc.0</code></pre>
    <p>
      The project is upgraded using <code>git apply</code> with 3-way merge, it
      may happen that you‚Äôll need to resolve a few conflicts after it‚Äôs
      finished.
    </p>
    <h4 id="resolve-the-conflicts">2. Resolve the conflicts</h4>
    <p>
      Conflicted files include delimiters which make very clear where the
      changes come from. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>13B07F951A680F5B00A75B9A /* Release */ = {
  isa = XCBuildConfiguration;
  buildSettings = {
    ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon;
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ours
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;;
    FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = (
      &quot;$(inherited)&quot;,
      &quot;$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK.embeddedframework&quot;,
      &quot;$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK-iOS/HockeySDK.embeddedframework&quot;,
    );
=======
    CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs
    HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = (
      &quot;$(inherited)&quot;,
      /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include,
      &quot;$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React/**&quot;,
      &quot;$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-code-push/ios/CodePush/**&quot;,
    );</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can think of ‚Äúours‚Äù as ‚Äúyour team‚Äù and ‚Äútheirs‚Äù as ‚Äúthe React Native
      development team‚Äù.
    </p>
    <h3 id="upgrade-helper">Upgrade Helper</h3>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/"
        >Upgrade Helper</a
      >
      is a web tool to help you out when upgrading your apps by providing the
      full set of changes happening between any two versions. It also shows
      comments on specific files to help understanding why that change is
      needed.
    </p>
    <h4 id="select-the-versions">1. Select the versions</h4>
    <p>
      You first need to select from and to which version you wish to upgrade, by
      default the latest major versions are selected. After selecting you can
      click the button ‚ÄúShow me how to upgrade‚Äù.
    </p>
    <p>
      üí° Major updates will show an ‚Äúuseful content‚Äù section on the top with
      links to help you out when upgrading.
    </p>
    <h4 id="upgrade-dependencies">2. Upgrade dependencies</h4>
    <p>
      The first file that is shown is the <code>package.json</code>, it‚Äôs good
      to update the dependencies that are showing in there. For example, if
      <code>react-native</code> and <code>react</code> appears as changes then
      you can install it in your project by running <code>yarn add</code>:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code># {{VERSION}} and {{REACT_VERSION}} are the release versions showing in the diff
yarn add react-native@{{VERSION}}
yarn add react@{{REACT_VERSION}}</code></pre>
    <h4 id="upgrade-your-project-files">3. Upgrade your project files</h4>
    <p>
      The new release may contain updates to other files that are generated when
      you run <code>npx react-native init</code>, those files are listed after
      the <code>package.json</code> in the Upgrade Helper page. If there aren‚Äôt
      other changes then you only need to rebuild the project to continue
      developing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case there are changes then you can either update them manually by
      copying and pasting from the changes in the page or you can do it with the
      React Native CLI upgrade command by running:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>npx react-native upgrade</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will check your files against the latest template and perform the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is a new file in the template, it is created.</li>
      <li>
        If a file in the template is identical to your file, it is skipped.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a file is different in your project than the template, you will be
        prompted; you have options to keep your file or overwrite it with the
        template version.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Some upgrades won‚Äôt be done automatically with the React Native CLI and
        require manual work, e.g.¬†<code>0.28</code> to <code>0.29</code>, or
        <code>0.56</code> to <code>0.57</code>. Make sure to check the
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases"
          >release notes</a
        >
        when upgrading so that you can identify any manual changes your
        particular project may require.
      </p>

      I want to upgrade with React Native CLI but I don‚Äôt use Git
    </h4>
    <p>
      While your project does not have to be handled by the Git versioning
      system ‚Äì you can use Mercurial, SVN, or nothing ‚Äì you will still need to
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">install Git</a> on your system in
      order to use <code>npx react-native upgrade</code>. Git will also need to
      be available in the <code>PATH</code>. If your project doesn‚Äôt use Git,
      initialize it and commit:
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>git init # Initialize a Git repository
git add . # Stage all the current files
git commit -m &quot;Upgrade react-native&quot; # Save the current files in a commit</code></pre>
    <p>
      After you finish upgrading you may remove the <code>.git</code> directory.

    </h4>
    <p>
      These sort of errors are usually related to caching, it‚Äôs recommended to
      install
      <a href="https://github.com/pmadruga/react-native-clean-project"
        >react-native-clean-project</a
      >
      to clear all your project‚Äôs cache and then you can run it again.
