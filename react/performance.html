    <p>
      A compelling reason for using React Native instead of WebView-based tools
      is to achieve 60 frames per second and a native look and feel to your
      apps. Where possible, we would like for React Native to do the right thing
      and help you to focus on your app instead of performance optimization, but
      there are areas where we’re not quite there yet, and others where React
      Native (similar to writing native code directly) cannot possibly determine
      the best way to optimize for you and so manual intervention will be
      necessary. We try our best to deliver buttery-smooth UI performance by
      default, but sometimes that isn’t possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide is intended to teach you some basics to help you to
      <a href="profiling.md">troubleshoot performance issues</a>, as well as
      discuss
      <a href="performance.md#common-sources-of-performance-problems"
        >common sources of problems and their suggested solutions</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-frames">
      What you need to know about frames
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your grandparents’ generation called movies
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i40rnpOsA"
        >“moving pictures”</a
      >
      for a reason: realistic motion in video is an illusion created by quickly
      changing static images at a consistent speed. We refer to each of these
      images as frames. The number of frames that is displayed each second has a
      direct impact on how smooth and ultimately life-like a video (or user
      interface) seems to be. iOS devices display 60 frames per second, which
      gives you and the UI system about 16.67ms to do all of the work needed to
      generate the static image (frame) that the user will see on the screen for
      that interval. If you are unable to do the work necessary to generate that
      frame within the allotted 16.67ms, then you will “drop a frame” and the UI
      will appear unresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to confuse the matter a little bit, open up the developer menu in your
      app and toggle <code>Show Perf Monitor</code>. You will notice that there
      are two different frame rates.
    </p>
    <p><img src="/docs/assets/PerfUtil.png" /></p>
    <h3 id="js-frame-rate-javascript-thread">
      JS frame rate (JavaScript thread)
    </h3>
    <p>
      For most React Native applications, your business logic will run on the
      JavaScript thread. This is where your React application lives, API calls
      are made, touch events are processed, etc… Updates to native-backed views
      are batched and sent over to the native side at the end of each iteration
      of the event loop, before the frame deadline (if all goes well). If the
      JavaScript thread is unresponsive for a frame, it will be considered a
      dropped frame. For example, if you were to call
      <code>this.setState</code> on the root component of a complex application
      and it resulted in re-rendering computationally expensive component
      subtrees, it’s conceivable that this might take 200ms and result in 12
      frames being dropped. Any animations controlled by JavaScript would appear
      to freeze during that time. If anything takes longer than 100ms, the user
      will feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This often happens during <code>Navigator</code> transitions: when you
      push a new route, the JavaScript thread needs to render all of the
      components necessary for the scene in order to send over the proper
      commands to the native side to create the backing views. It’s common for
      the work being done here to take a few frames and cause
      <a href="http://jankfree.org/">jank</a> because the transition is
      controlled by the JavaScript thread. Sometimes components will do
      additional work on <code>componentDidMount</code>, which might result in a
      second stutter in the transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example is responding to touches: if you are doing work across
      multiple frames on the JavaScript thread, you might notice a delay in
      responding to <code>TouchableOpacity</code>, for example. This is because
      the JavaScript thread is busy and cannot process the raw touch events sent
      over from the main thread. As a result,
      <code>TouchableOpacity</code> cannot react to the touch events and command
      the native view to adjust its opacity.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ui-frame-rate-main-thread">UI frame rate (main thread)</h3>
    <p>
      Many people have noticed that performance of <code>NavigatorIOS</code> is
      better out of the box than <code>Navigator</code>. The reason for this is
      that the animations for the transitions are done entirely on the main
      thread, and so they are not interrupted by frame drops on the JavaScript
      thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, you can happily scroll up and down through a
      <code>ScrollView</code> when the JavaScript thread is locked up because
      the <code>ScrollView</code> lives on the main thread. The scroll events
      are dispatched to the JS thread, but their receipt is not necessary for
      the scroll to occur.

    <h3 id="running-in-development-mode-devtrue">
      Running in development mode (<code>dev=true</code>)
    </h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript thread performance suffers greatly when running in dev mode.
      This is unavoidable: a lot more work needs to be done at runtime to
      provide you with good warnings and error messages, such as validating
      propTypes and various other assertions. Always make sure to test
      performance in

    <h3 id="using-console.log-statements">
      Using <code>console.log</code> statements
    </h3>
    <p>
      When running a bundled app, these statements can cause a big bottleneck in
      the JavaScript thread. This includes calls from debugging libraries such
      as
      <a href="https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger">redux-logger</a>,
      so make sure to remove them before bundling. You can also use this
      <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-remove-console/"
        >babel plugin</a
      >
      that removes all the <code>console.*</code> calls. You need to install it
      first with
      <code>npm i babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev</code>, and
      then edit the <code>.babelrc</code> file under your project directory like
      this:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode json"
      ><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">&quot;env&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">    <span class="dt">&quot;production&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">      <span class="dt">&quot;plugins&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span><span class="st">&quot;transform-remove-console&quot;</span><span class="ot">]</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6">  <span class="fu">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" title="7"><span class="fu">}</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      This will automatically remove all <code>console.*</code> calls in the
      release (production) versions of your project.

      <code>ListView</code> initial rendering is too slow or scroll performance

    </h3>
    <p>
      Use the new <a href="flatlist.md"><code>FlatList</code></a> or
      <a href="sectionlist.md"><code>SectionList</code></a> component instead.
      Besides simplifying the API, the new list components also have significant
      performance enhancements, the main one being nearly constant memory usage
      for any number of rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your <a href="flatlist.md"><code>FlatList</code></a> is rendering slow,
      be sure that you’ve implemented
      <a href="flatlist.md#getitemlayout"><code>getItemLayout</code></a> to
      optimize rendering speed by skipping measurement of the rendered items.
    </p>
    <h3 id="js-fps-plunges-when-re-rendering-a-view-that-hardly-changes">
      JS FPS plunges when re-rendering a view that hardly changes
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you are using a ListView, you must provide a
      <code>rowHasChanged</code> function that can reduce a lot of work by
      quickly determining whether or not a row needs to be re-rendered. If you
      are using immutable data structures, this would only need to be a
      reference equality check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, you can implement <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> and
      indicate the exact conditions under which you would like the component to
      re-render. If you write pure components (where the return value of the
      render function is entirely dependent on props and state), you can
      leverage PureComponent to do this for you. Once again, immutable data
      structures are useful to keep this fast – if you have to do a deep
      comparison of a large list of objects, it may be that re-rendering your
      entire component would be quicker, and it would certainly require less
      code.

      Dropping JS thread FPS because of doing a lot of work on the JavaScript
      thread at the same time
    </h3>
    <p>
      “Slow Navigator transitions” is the most common manifestation of this, but
      there are other times this can happen. Using InteractionManager can be a
      good approach, but if the user experience cost is too high to delay work
      during an animation, then you might want to consider LayoutAnimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Animated API currently calculates each keyframe on-demand on the
      JavaScript thread unless you
      <a
        href="/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated#how-do-i-use-this-in-my-app"
        >set <code>useNativeDriver: true</code></a
      >, while LayoutAnimation leverages Core Animation and is unaffected by JS
      thread and main thread frame drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      One case where I have used this is for animating in a modal (sliding down
      from top and fading in a translucent overlay) while initializing and
      perhaps receiving responses for several network requests, rendering the
      contents of the modal, and updating the view where the modal was opened
      from. See the Animations guide for more information about how to use
      LayoutAnimation.
    </p>
    <p>Caveats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        LayoutAnimation only works for fire-and-forget animations (“static”
        animations) – if it must be interruptible, you will need to use
        <code>Animated</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3
      id="moving-a-view-on-the-screen-scrolling-translating-rotating-drops-ui-thread-fps"
    >
      Moving a view on the screen (scrolling, translating, rotating) drops UI
      thread FPS
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is especially true when you have text with a transparent background
      positioned on top of an image, or any other situation where alpha
      compositing would be required to re-draw the view on each frame. You will
      find that enabling <code>shouldRasterizeIOS</code> or
      <code>renderToHardwareTextureAndroid</code> can help with this
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful not to overuse this or your memory usage could go through the
      roof. Profile your performance and memory usage when using these props. If
      you don’t plan to move a view anymore, turn this property off.
    </p>
    <h3 id="animating-the-size-of-an-image-drops-ui-thread-fps">
      Animating the size of an image drops UI thread FPS
    </h3>
    <p>
      On iOS, each time you adjust the width or height of an Image component it
      is re-cropped and scaled from the original image. This can be very
      expensive, especially for large images. Instead, use the
      <code>transform: [{scale}]</code> style property to animate the size. An
      example of when you might do this is when you tap an image and zoom it in
      to full screen.
    </p>
    <h3 id="my-touchablex-view-isnt-very-responsive">
      My TouchableX view isn’t very responsive
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, if we do an action in the same frame that we are adjusting the
      opacity or highlight of a component that is responding to a touch, we
      won’t see that effect until after the <code>onPress</code> function has
      returned. If <code>onPress</code> does a <code>setState</code> that
      results in a lot of work and a few frames dropped, this may occur. A
      solution to this is to wrap any action inside of your
      <code>onPress</code> handler in <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="jsx"><code>handleOnPress() {
  requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; {
    this.doExpensiveAction();
  });
}</code></pre>
    <h3 id="slow-navigator-transitions">Slow navigator transitions</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, <code>Navigator</code> animations are controlled by
      the JavaScript thread. Imagine the “push from right” scene transition:
      each frame, the new scene is moved from the right to left, starting
      offscreen (let’s say at an x-offset of 320) and ultimately settling when
      the scene sits at an x-offset of 0. Each frame during this transition, the
      JavaScript thread needs to send a new x-offset to the main thread. If the
      JavaScript thread is locked up, it cannot do this and so no update occurs
      on that frame and the animation stutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One solution to this is to allow for JavaScript-based animations to be
      offloaded to the main thread. If we were to do the same thing as in the
      above example with this approach, we might calculate a list of all
      x-offsets for the new scene when we are starting the transition and send
      them to the main thread to execute in an optimized way. Now that the
      JavaScript thread is freed of this responsibility, it’s not a big deal if
      it drops a few frames while rendering the scene – you probably won’t even
      notice because you will be too distracted by the pretty transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving this is one of the main goals behind the new
      <a href="navigation.md">React Navigation</a> library. The views in React
      Navigation use native components and the
      <a href="animated.md"><code>Animated</code></a> library to deliver 60 FPS
      animations that are run on the native thread.
