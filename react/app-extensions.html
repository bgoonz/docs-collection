      App extensions let you provide custom functionality and content outside of
      your main app. There are different types of app extensions on iOS, and
      they are all covered in the

        >App Extension Programming Guide</a
      >. In this guide, we’ll briefly cover how you may take advantage of app
      extensions on iOS.

    <h2 id="memory-use-in-extensions">Memory use in extensions</h2>
    <p>
      As these extensions are loaded outside of the regular app sandbox, it’s
      highly likely that several of these app extensions will be loaded
      simultaneously. As you might expect, these extensions have small memory
      usage limits. Keep these in mind when developing your app extensions. It’s
      always highly recommended to test your application on an actual device,
      and more so when developing app extensions: too frequently, developers
      find that their extension works fine in the iOS Simulator, only to get
      user reports that their extension is not loading on actual devices.

    <h3 id="today-widget">Today widget</h3>
    <p>
      The memory limit of a Today widget is 16 MB. As it happens, Today widget
      implementations using React Native may work unreliably because the memory
      usage tends to be too high. You can tell if your Today widget is exceeding
      the memory limit if it yields the message ‘Unable to Load’:
    </p>
    <p><img src="/docs/assets/TodayWidgetUnableToLoad.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
      Always make sure to test your app extensions in a real device, but be
      aware that this may not be sufficient, especially when dealing with Today
      widgets. Debug-configured builds are more likely to exceed the memory
      limits, while release-configured builds don’t fail right away. We highly
      recommend that you use
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/index.html"
        >Xcode’s Instruments</a
      >
      to analyze your real world memory usage, as it’s very likely that your
      release-configured build is very close to the 16 MB limit. In situations
      like these, you can quickly go over the 16 MB limit by performing common
      operations, such as fetching data from an API.
    </p>
    <p>
      To experiment with the limits of React Native Today widget
      implementations, try extending the example project in
      <a href="https://github.com/matejkriz/react-native-today-widget/"
        >react-native-today-widget</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="other-app-extensions">Other app extensions</h3>
    <p>
      Other types of app extensions have greater memory limits than the Today
      widget. For instance, Custom Keyboard extensions are limited to 48 MB, and
      Share extensions are limited to 120 MB. Implementing such app extensions
      with React Native is more viable. One proof of concept example is
