<p>It’s always a good idea to test your app on an actual device before releasing it to your users. This document will guide you through the necessary steps to run your React Native app on a device and to get it ready for production.</p>
<p>If you used Expo CLI or Create React Native App to set up your project, you can preview your app on a device by scanning the QR code with the Expo app—but in order to build and run your app on a device, you will need to eject and install the native code dependencies from the <a href="environment-setup">environment setup guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="enable-debugging-over-usb">1. Enable Debugging over USB</h3>
<p>Most Android devices can only install and run apps downloaded from Google Play, by default. You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development.</p>
<p>To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the “Developer options” menu by going to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>About phone</strong> → <strong>Software information</strong> and then tapping the <code>Build number</code> row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Developer options</strong> to enable “USB debugging”.</p>
<h3 id="plug-in-your-device-via-usb">2. Plug in your device via USB</h3>
<p>Let’s now set up an Android device to run our React Native projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.</p>
<p>Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running <code>adb devices</code>.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator
14ed2fcc device         # Physical device</code></pre>
<p>Seeing <code>device</code> in the right column means the device is connected. You must have <strong>only one device connected</strong> at a time.</p>
<h3 id="run-your-app">3. Run your app</h3>
<p>Type the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ npx react-native run-android</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you get a “bridge configuration isn’t available” error, see <a href="running-on-device.md#method-1-using-adb-reverse-recommended">Using adb reverse</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: You can also use the <code>React Native CLI</code> to generate and run a <code>Release</code> build (e.g. <code>npx react-native run-android --variant=release</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Connecting to the development server
</h2>
<p>You can also iterate quickly on a device by connecting to the development server running on your development machine. There are several ways of accomplishing this, depending on whether you have access to a USB cable or a Wi-Fi network.</p>
<h3 id="method-1-using-adb-reverse-recommended">Method 1: Using adb reverse (recommended)</h3>
<p>You can use this method if your device is running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or newer, it has USB debugging enabled, and it is connected via USB to your development machine.</p>
<p>Run the following in a command prompt:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ adb -s &lt;device name&gt; reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081</code></pre>
<p>To find the device name, run the following adb command:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ adb devices</code></pre>
<p>You can now enable Live reloading from the <a href="debugging.md#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu">Developer menu</a>. Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-connect-via-wi-fi">Method 2: Connect via Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>You can also connect to the development server over Wi-Fi. You’ll first need to install the app on your device using a USB cable, but once that has been done you can debug wirelessly by following these instructions. You’ll need your development machine’s current IP address before proceeding.</p>
<p>You can find the IP address in <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Network</strong>.</p>

<p>Next, check the manufacturer code by using <code>lsusb</code> (on mac, you must first <a href="https://github.com/jlhonora/lsusb">install lsusb</a>). <code>lsusb</code> should output something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" title="1">$ <span class="ex">lsusb</span></a>

<p>These lines represent the USB devices currently connected to your machine.</p>
<p>You want the line that represents your phone. If you’re in doubt, try unplugging your phone and running the command again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" title="1">$ <span class="ex">lsusb</span></a>

<p>You’ll see that after removing the phone, the line which has the phone model (“Motorola PCS” in this case) disappeared from the list. This is the line that we care about.</p>
<p><code>Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS</code></p>
<p>From the above line, you want to grab the first four digits from the device ID:</p>
<p><code>22b8:2e76</code></p>
<p>In this case, it’s <code>22b8</code>. That’s the identifier for Motorola.</p>
<p>You’ll need to input this into your udev rules in order to get up and running:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>echo &#39;SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;22b8&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;&#39; | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that you replace <code>22b8</code> with the identifier you get in the above command.</p>
<p>Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running <code>adb devices</code>.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator
14ed2fcc device         # Physical device</code></pre>
<p>Seeing <code>device</code> in the right column means the device is connected. You must have <strong>only one device connected</strong> at a time.</p>
<h3 id="run-your-app-2">3. Run your app</h3>
<p>Type the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:</p>

<p>If you have any issues, ensure that your Mac and device are on the same network and can reach each other. Many open wireless networks with captive portals are configured to prevent devices from reaching other devices on the network. You may use your device’s Personal Hotspot feature in this case. You may also share your internet (WiFi/Ethernet) connection from your Mac to your device via USB and connect to the bundler through this tunnel for very high transfer speeds.</p>

<p>When trying to connect to the development server you might get a <a href="debugging.md#in-app-errors-and-warnings">red screen with an error</a> saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connection to <code>http://localhost:8081/debugger-proxy?role=client</code> timed out. Are you running node proxy? If you are running on the device, check if you have the right IP address in <code>RCTWebSocketExecutor.m</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this issue check the following points.</p>
<h4 id="wi-fi-network.">1. Wi-Fi network.</h4>
<p>Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the <strong>same</strong> Wi-Fi network.</p>
<h4 id="ip-address">2. IP address</h4>
<p>Make sure that the build script detected the IP address of your machine correctly (e.g. 10.0.1.123).</p>
<p><img src="/docs/assets/XcodeBuildIP.png" /></p>
<p>Open the <strong>Report navigator</strong> tab, select the last <strong>Build</strong> and search for <code>IP=</code> followed by an IP address. The IP address which gets embedded in the app should match your machines IP address.</p>
