The Native Client Security Contest has ended—check out the <a href="/docs/native-client/community/security-contest/index#contest-winners" class="reference internal"><em>winning submissions</em></a>. We welcome your continued involvement in the project. You can help by submitting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/list" class="reference external">bugs</a> and participating in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/native-client-discuss" class="reference external">Native Client discussion group</a>.

Do you think it is impossible to safely run untrusted x86 code on the web? Do you want a chance to impress a panel of some of the <a href="/docs/native-client/community/security-contest/index#contest-judges" class="reference internal"><em>top security experts</em></a> in the world? Then submit an exploit to the Native Client Security contest and you could also win <a href="/docs/native-client/community/security-contest/contest-faq#contest-faq-prizes" class="reference internal"><em>cash prizes</em></a>, not to mention bragging rights.
