<hr />
<p>This glossary defines terms and names commonly used throughout the Native Client documentation.</p>
<p>asynchronous programming<br />
In the asynchronous programming model, function calls are executed and return immediately without waiting for a response. Using this model, function calls are non-blocking; the web browser continues its main thread of execution and gets notified of asynchronous call completion through callbacks or some other mechanism.</p>
<p>focus events<br />
Events that indicate whether certain parts of a web page are in or out of focus.</p>
<p>input events<br />
Events that occur when an input device (such as keyboard or mouse) is used to interact with an module instance.</p>
<p>instance<br />
A rectangle on a web page that is managed by a Native Client module (the rectangle can have <code>width=0</code> and <code>height=0</code>, which means that nothing is drawn on the page).</p>
<p>manifest file<br />
A file containing metadata or information about accompanying files.</p>
<p>message events<br />
Events used to pass data between JavaScript and the Native Client module (see the <a href="/docs/native-client/devguide/coding/message-system" class="reference internal"><em>Messaging System</em></a> section).</p>
<p>module<br />
Depending on context, “module” may mean one of two things. First, it may be a general short-term for for “Native Client module”—compiled C/C++ code produced with a Native Client toolchain (for example PNaCl). See <a href="/docs/native-client/overview#link-how-nacl-works" class="reference internal"><em>How Native Client works</em></a> for more details. Second, it may refer to a concrete implementation of the <a href="/docs/native-client/pepper_stable/cpp/classpp_1_1_module" class="reference external">pp::Module class</a> for some Native Client module.</p>
<p>progress events<br />
Events generated by the Native Client runtime system during the module loading process.</p>
<p>Var<br />
An object in a Native Client module that corresponds to a JavaScript variable.</p>
<p>view change events<br />
Events that occur when a change in the browser affects the module instance (such as resizing the browser window or going to and from fullscreen mode).</p>
<p>web workers<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Workers" class="reference external">Web workers</a> provide a mechanism for running heavy-weight JavaScript code on background threads so that the main web page can continue to respond to user interaction. Web pages interact with web workers by using <code>postMessage()</code> to send messages. The way a web page interacts with a Native Client module is analogous to the way it interacts with web workers.</p>
