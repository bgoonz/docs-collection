{% include ‘partials/extensions/mv2-legacy-page.md’ %}

These pages contain guides and reference information for developers who want to create extensions for the Chrome browser. If you’re not sure where to begin, have a look at the following starting pages:

-   [What are extensions?](/docs/extensions/mv2/overview/) to help you understand just what an extension is.
-   The [Getting started tutorial](/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/) if you’re ready for hello, world.

Beyond that, you might find useful entry points in these pages:

-   Learn the scope of things in the [Extension development overview](/docs/extensions/mv2/devguide/)
-   Pick something from the [samples page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/mv2-archive), install it, and start hacking on it.
-   Look for answers in the [Extensions FAQ page](/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/)

In addition to the documentation here, many developers find helpful community content at:

-   The [Chromium extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions) Google Group.
-   The Stack Overflow [google-chrome extension](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/google-chrome-extension/info) tag.

Thank you for being a member of the extension developer community. We’re glad you are here!
