Google provides three ways to run web content on tablets, smartphones, and other devices:

-   Using Chrome Mobile for devices running Android 4.0 and later, and iOS.
-   With the default Android browser, for devices running versions of Android earlier than 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).
-   Within a [WebView](/docs/multidevice/webview/) in a native Android application.

The Google Chrome Mobile browser is based on the same code used by Chrome for Desktop. See the following pages:

-   [Chrome for Android](/docs/multidevice/android/)
