      Is Chrome for Android open source?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chrome for Android is derived from Chromium. Since the launch of the first
      version, we have steadily open sourced all the critical components. You
      can build various Chromium components for Android as used in Chrome for
      Android using the instructions
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions"
        >here</a

    </h3>
    <p>
      Chrome for Android provides the same fast, secure, and stable web browsing
      experience you’ve come to enjoy when using Chrome on desktop. We’ve taken
      a different approach to tabs and overall navigation. By signing in to
      Chrome on Android, users can have a unified, personalized Chrome
      experience across all their devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a developer perspective, Chrome for Android supports powerful
      features like Chrome Developer Tools, Indexed DB, requestAnimationFrame,
      WebSockets and Web Workers.
