<p><strong>Important:</strong> Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/changes-to-chrome-app-support-timeline.html"><strong>Read the announcement</strong></a> and learn more about <a href="/apps/migration"><strong>migrating your app</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Chrome Apps let you use HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an experience comparable to a native application.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-a-chrome-app-why-build">Why build a Chrome App? {: #why-build }</h2>
<p>By building a Chrome App, as opposed to going with a traditional web app or a native mobile app, you expand your potential audience and extend your development capability.</p>
<h3 id="expand-your-potential-audience-expand">Expand your potential audience {: #expand }</h3>
<p>When you write a Chrome App, as opposed to an app that runs natively on a particular operating system, you immediately make your app available to a much wider audience.</p>
<p><strong>To any desktop</strong></p>
<p>Instead of writing and maintaining separate applications for Windows, OS X and Linux, you can write a single application that runs anywhere Chrome runs. This includes Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>
<p><strong>To mobile devices [via Cordova]</strong></p>
<p>Using <a href="apps/chrome_apps_on_mobile">Chrome Apps for Mobile</a> (MCA), you can deploy your applications to mobile and target hardware features only available on Android and IOS platforms.</p>
<p><strong>And of course, to a Chromebook</strong></p>
<p>Writing a Chrome App is the ONLY way to have your app installed on a Chromebook. Chromebooks are appealing, inexpensive, low maintenance devices that provide a full web experience.</p>
<h3 id="extend-your-development-capability-extend">Extend your development capability {: #extend }</h3>
<p>You might be thinking, “If I write a standard web application, I can run it on any platform that has a web browser.” Of course, this is absolutely right, but remember that Chrome Apps extend your development capacity beyond what you can do with traditional web apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome Apps can integrate seamlessly into the desktop and look more like desktop applications than traditional web apps.</li>
<li>Chrome Apps for Desktop have no omnibox (address bar) and tab strip like normal browser-based apps, because like native desktop apps, they don’t live in a browser.</li>
<li>The Chrome App Launcher makes it easy for users to find and start your Chrome App.</li>
<li>OS X users can use the integrated spotlight search to find and start your app.</li>
<li>Chrome Apps for Desktop can access the host computer’s file system and make use of hardware features (like USB, Bluetooth and attached human interface devices).</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to see what Chrome Apps look like is to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?_feature=chromeapp">install some</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-build-chrome-apps-who">Who should build Chrome Apps? {: #who }</h2>
<p>Everyone! But some sectors have a special interest in Chrome Apps.</p>
<p><strong>Device manufacturers</strong></p>
<p>The cross platform nature of Chrome Apps makes writing device drivers less painful. A device manufacturer only needs to write one application for configuring their device and it will run on any device.</p>
<p><strong>Educators</strong></p>
<p>Chromebooks are an inexpensive, low-maintenance option for bringing laptops into every classroom. Chrome Apps make teaching easy with easy to install applications that run natively on Chromebooks. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2014/08/more-teaching-less-tech-ing-google.html">More Teaching, Less Tech-ing</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health care providers</strong></p>
<p>One pediatric service has so far <a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2013/12/pediatric-home-service-puts-patient.html">saved tens of thousands of dollars</a> using Chrome Apps on Chromebooks.</p>
