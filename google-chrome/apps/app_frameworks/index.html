      Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and the Chrome Web Store will
      continue to support extensions.

      As modern browsers become more powerful with rich features, building
      full-blown web applications in JavaScript is not only feasible, but
      increasingly popular. Based on

      With JavaScript’s popularity climbing, our client-side applications are
      much more complex than before. Application development requires
      collaboration from multiple developers. Writing
      <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>reusable</strong> code is
      crucial in the new web app era. The Chrome App, with its rich client-side
      features, is no exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design patterns are important to write maintainable and reusable code. A
      pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring
      problems in software design—in our case—writing Chrome Apps. We recommend
      that developers decouple the app into a series of independent components
      following the MVC pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last few years, a series of JavaScript MVC frameworks have been
      developed, such as <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a>,
      <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a>,
      <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>,
      <a href="http://sencha.com/">Sencha</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kendoui.com/">Kendo UI</a>, and more. While they all
      have their unique advantages, each one of them follows some form of MVC
      pattern with the goal of encouraging developers to write more structured
      JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <h2 id="mvc-pattern-overview-mvc">MVC pattern overview {: #mvc }</h2>
    <p>
      MVC offers architectural benefits over standard JavaScript—it helps you
      write better organized, and therefore more maintainable code. This pattern
      has been used and extensively tested over multiple languages and
      generations of programmers.
    </p>
    <p>MVC is composed of three components:</p>
    <p>
      {% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/BHGcFQr06iG3kquyozom.png”,
      alt=“model-view-controller”, height=“303”, width=“466” %}
    </p>
    <h3 id="model-model">Model {: #model }</h3>
    <p>
      Model is where the application’s data objects are stored. The model
      doesn’t know anything about views and controllers. When a model changes,
      typically it will notify its observers that a change has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand this further, let’s use the Todo list app, a simple, one
      page web app that tracks your task list.
    </p>
    <p>
      {% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/7WQXOcG3PNRhnsjnsvjx.png”,
      alt=“model-view-controller”, height=“366”, width=“444” %}
    </p>
    <p>
      The model here represents attributes associated with each todo item such
      as description and status. When a new todo item is created, it is stored
      in an instance of the model.
    </p>
    <h3 id="view-view">View {: #view }</h3>
    <p>
      View is what’s presented to the users and how users interact with the app.
      The view is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and often templates. This part
      of your Chrome App has access to the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in the above todo list web app, you can create a view that
      nicely presents the list of todo items to your users. Users can also enter
      a new todo item through some input format; however, the view doesn’t know
      how to update the model because that’s the controller’s job.
    </p>
    <h3 id="controller-controller">Controller {: #controller }</h3>
    <p>
      The controller is the decision maker and the glue between the model and
      view. The controller updates the view when the model changes. It also adds
      event listeners to the view and updates the model when the user
      manipulates the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the todo list web app, when the user checks an item as completed, the
      click is forwarded to the controller. The controller modifies the model to
      mark item as completed. If the data needs to be persistent, it also makes
      an async save to the server. In rich client-side web app development such
      as Chrome Apps, keeping the data persistent in local storage is also
      crucial. In this case, the controller also handles saving the data to the
      client-side storage such as <a href="app_storage">FileSystem API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few variations of the MVC design pattern such as MVP
      (Model–View–Presenter) and MVVP(Model–View–ViewModel). Even with the so
      called MVC design pattern itself, there is some variation between the
      traditional MVC pattern vs the modern interpretation in various
      programming languages. For example, some MVC–based frameworks will have
      the view observe the changes in the models while others will let the
      controller handle the view update. This article is not focused on the
      comparison of various implementations but rather on the
      separation–of–concerns and it’s importance in writing modern web apps.

    <p>
      To summarize, the MVC pattern brings modularity to application developers
      and it enables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusable and extendable code.</li>
      <li>Separation of view logic from business logic.</li>
      <li>
        Allow simultaneous work between developers who are responsible for
        different components (such as UI layer and core logic).
      </li>
      <li>Easier to maintain.</li>

      MVC persistence patterns {: #mvcpersistence }
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many different ways of implementing persistence with an MVC
      framework, each with different trade–offs. When writing Chrome Apps,
      choose the frameworks with MVC and persistence patterns that feel natural
      to you and fit you application needs.

      Model does its own persistence - ActiveRecord pattern {:
      #model_persistence }
    </h3>
    <p>
      Popular in both server–side frameworks like Ruby on Rails, and client-side
      frameworks like <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> and
      <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a>, the ActiveRecord pattern
      places the responsibility for persistence on the model itself and is
      typically implemented via JSON API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slightly different take from having a model handle the persistence is to
      introduce a separate concept of Store and Adapter API. Store, Model and
      Adapter (in some frameworks it is called Proxy) work hand by hand. Store
      is the repository that holds the loaded models, and it also provides
      functions such as creating, querying and filtering the model instances
      contained within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An adapter, or a proxy, receives the requests from a store and translates
      them into appropriate actions to take against your persistent data layer
      (such as JSON API). This is interesting in the modern web app design
      because you often interact with more than one persistent data layer such
      as a remote server and browser’s local storage. Chrome Apps provides both
      <a href="storage">Chrome Storage API</a> and
      <a href="fileSystem">HTML 5 fileSystem API</a> for client side storage.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple to use and understand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hard to test since the persistence layer is ‘baked’ into the object
        hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Having different objects use different persistent stores is difficult
        (for example, FileSystem APIs vs indexedDB vs server–side).
      </li>
      <li>
        Reusing Model in other applications may create conflicts, such as
        sharing a single Customer class between two different views, each view
        wanting to save to different places.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="controller-does-persistence-controller_persistence">
      Controller does persistence {: #controller_persistence }
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this pattern, the controller holds a reference to both the model and a
      datastore and is responsible for keeping the model persisted. The
      controller responds to lifecycle events like Load, Save, Delete, and
      issues commands to the datastore to fetch or update the model.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Easier to test, controller can be passed a mock datastore to write tests
        against.
      </li>
      <li>
        The same model can be reused with multiple datastores just by
        constructing controllers with different datastores.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code can be more complex to maintain.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="appcontroller-does-persistence-app_controller">
      AppController does persistence {: #app_controller }
    </h3>
    <p>
      In some patterns, there is a supervising controller responsible for
      navigating between one MVC and another. The AppController decides, for
      example, that a ‘Back’ button moves the client from an editing screen
      (which contains MVC widgets/formats), to a settings screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the AppController pattern, the AppController responds to events and
      changes the app’s current screen by issuing a call to the datastore to
      load any models needed and constructing all of the matching views and
      controllers for that screen.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Moves persistence layer even higher up the stack where it can be easily
        changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn’t pollute lower level controllers like a DatePickerController with
        the need to know about persistence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each ‘Page/Screen’ of the app now requires a lot of boilerplate to write
        or update: Model, View, Controller, AppController.
      </li>
    </ul>
