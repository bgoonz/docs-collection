      This guide aims to help users who primarily rely on assistive technology
      like screen readers access and use
      <a href="/docs/devtools">Chrome DevTools</a>. Chrome DevTools is a suite
      of web developer tools built into the Google Chrome browser. See
      <a href="/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference"
        >Accessibility Reference</a
      >
      if you’re looking for DevTools features related to improving the
      accessibility of a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accessibility of DevTools is a work-in-progress. Some panels and tabs
      work better with assistive technology than others. This guide walks you
      through the panels which are the most accessible and highlights specific
      issues you may encounter along the way.
    </p>
    <h2 id="overview-overview">Overview {: #overview }</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting, it helps to have a mental model of how the DevTools UI is
      structured. DevTools is divided into a series of <em>panels</em> which are
      organized into an
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tablist"
        >ARIA <code>tablist</code></a
      >. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>Elements</strong> panel lets you view and change
        <a href="/docs/devtools/dom">DOM nodes</a> or
        <a href="/docs/devtools/css">CSS</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="/docs/devtools/console"><strong>Console</strong> panel</a> lets
        you read JavaScript logs and live edit objects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Within the content area of each panel, there are a number of different
      tools, often referred to as <em>tabs</em> or <em>panes</em> in the
      documentation. For instance, the <strong>Elements</strong> panel contains
      additional tabs to inspect event listeners, the accessibility tree, and
      much more. The distinction between tabs and panes is somewhat arbitrary.
      The only reason you’ll see one term or the other is to maintain
      consistency with the rest of the official DevTools documentation.

      The

        >DevTools Keyboard Shortcuts reference</a

      is a helpful cheatsheet. Be sure to bookmark it and refer back to it as
      you explore the different panels.

    <h2 id="open-devtools-open">Open DevTools {: #open }</h2>
    <p>
      To get started, read through
      <a href="/docs/devtools/open">Open Chrome DevTools</a>. There are a number
      of ways to open DevTools, either through keyboard shortcuts or menu items.

    <ul>
      <li>
        With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> or
        <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd> (Mac) to focus the next panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd>
        (Mac) to focus the previous panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s also possible to use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus
        into a panel’s <code>tablist</code> and use the arrow keys to change
        panels, though it may be faster to use the previously mentioned
        shortcuts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="known-issues-keynavissues">Known issues {: #keynavissues }</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some panels, such as the <strong>Console</strong> and
        <strong>Performance</strong> panels, may move focus into their content
        area as soon as they are activated. This can make navigating by arrow
        keys difficult.
      </li>
      <li>
        The selected panel’s name is announced, but only after it has read the
        focused content in the panel. This can make it very easy to miss.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="navigate-by-command-menu-commandmenunav">
      Navigate by Command Menu {: #commandmenunav }
    </h3>
    <p>
      To focus a specific panel, use the
      <a href="/docs/devtools/command-menu/"><strong>Command Menu</strong></a
      >:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        With DevTools open, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd
          >P</kbd
        >
        or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) to open the
        <strong>Command Menu</strong>. The <strong>Command Menu</strong> is a
        fuzzy search autocomplete combobox.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type the name of the panel you’d like to open, then use the
        <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard to navigate to the correct option.
      </li>
      <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run a command.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, to open the <strong>Elements</strong> panel:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Open the <strong>Command Menu</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        Type <kbd>E</kbd> then <kbd>L</kbd>. The
        <strong>Panel &gt; Show Elements</strong> option is selected.
      </li>
      <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the command that opens the panel.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Opening a panel this way directs focus to the contents of the panel
      itself. In the case of the <strong>Elements</strong> panel, focus moves
      into the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elements-panel-elements">Elements panel {: #elements }</h2>
    <h3 id="inspect-an-element-on-the-page-inspect">
      Inspect an element on the page {: #inspect }

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Navigate to the element you want to inspect using the screen reader’s
        cursor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simulate a right-mouse click on the element to open the context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose the <strong>Inspect</strong> option. This opens the
        <a href="/docs/devtools/dom"><strong>Elements</strong> panel</a> and
        focuses the element in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The <strong>DOM Tree</strong> is laid out as an
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree"
        >ARIA <code>tree</code></a
      >. See
      <a href="/docs/devtools/dom#keynav"

        <strong>Copy outerHTML</strong> often doesn’t select the current node
        but instead selects its parent node. However, the contents of the
        element should still be in the copied outerHTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="modify-the-attributes-of-an-element-in-the-dom-tree-attributes">

        With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press
        <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear
        “space” you are inside of an empty text input and can type a new
        attribute value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd
          >Enter</kbd

    <h4 id="known-issues-attributesissues">
      Known issues {: #attributesissues }
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you type into the text input you get no feedback. If you make a
        typo and use the arrow keys to explore your input you also get no
        feedback. The easiest way to check your work is to accept the change,
        then listen for the entire element to be announced.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="edit-the-html-of-an-element-in-the-dom-tree-nodetype">
      Edit the HTML of an element in the DOM Tree {: #nodetype }
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press
        <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it editable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between attribute values. When you hear the
        element’s name, for instance, “h2”, you are inside of a text input and
        may change the element’s type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd
          >Enter</kbd
        >
        (Mac) to accept the change.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, typing <code>h3</code> and pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd
        >Enter</kbd
      >
      or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) changes the element’s start
      and end tags to <code>h3</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elements-panel-tabs-elementstabs">
      Elements panel tabs {: #elementstabs }
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Elements</strong> panel contains additional tabs for
      inspecting things like the CSS applied to an element or its place in the
      accessibility tree.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With focus on a node in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, press
        <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you hear that the <strong>Styles</strong> pane is
        selected.
      </li>
      <li>Use the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to explore other available tabs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>DOM Tree</strong> turns elements with
      <code>href</code> attributes into focusable links, so you may need to
      press <kbd>Tab</kbd> more than once to reach the Styles pane.
    </p>
    <h3 id="known-issues-elementstabsissues">
      Known issues {: #elementstabsissues }
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>DOM Breakpoints</strong> and <strong>Properties</strong> tabs
      are not keyboard accessible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="styles-pane-styles">Styles pane {: #styles }</h3>
    <p>
      In the <strong>Styles</strong> pane you’ll find controls for filtering
      styles, toggling element states (such as
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active"
        ><code>:active</code></a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus"
        ><code>:focus</code></a
      >), toggling classes, and adding new classes. There is also a powerful
      style inspection tool to explore and modify styles currently applied to
      the element that’s in focus in the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key concept to understand about the <strong>Styles</strong> pane is
      that it only shows styles for the currently-selected node in the
      <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. For example, suppose you’re done inspecting the
      styles of a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> node, and now you want to look at
      the styles for a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> node. To do that, you first
      need to select the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> node in the
      <strong>DOM Tree</strong>. You might find it faster to use the
      <a href="#inspect">Inspect</a> workflow to inspect a node that’s in the
      general vicinity of the <code>footer</code> node (such as a link within
      the footer), which focuses the <strong>DOM Tree</strong>, and then use
      your keyboard to navigate to the exact node that you’re interested in.
    </p>
    <h4 id="navigate-the-styles-pane-stylesnav">
      Navigate the Styles pane {: #stylesnav }
    </h4>
    <p>
      Because all of the style tools connect in one way or another back to the
      <strong>Styles</strong> pane, it makes sense to become an expert in this
      tool first.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With focus on the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to
        move focus inside and explore its contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first style becomes active. If you’re
        using a screen reader this first style will be announced as
        “element.style {}”.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to navigate the list of styles in order of
        specificity. A screen reader announces each style starting with the name
        of the CSS file, the line number that the style appears on, and the
        style name itself. For example: “main.css:233 .card__img {}”
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to inspect a style in more detail. Focus begins
        on an editable version of the style name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between editable versions of each CSS
        property and their corresponding values. At the end of each style block
        is a blank editable text field which you may use to add additional CSS
        properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may continue to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the list of
        styles, or press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to exit this mode and go back to
        navigating by arrow keys.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Be sure to read through

      <li>
        Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand the collection of element states. The
        element states are presented as a group of checkboxes.

      <li>
        Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> until the first state, <code>:active</code>, has
        focus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to enable it. If the currently-selected element
        in the DOM Tree has an <code>:active</code> style, it’s now applied.

      labeled <strong>Add New Class</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Element Classes</strong> button is primarily used for adding
      existing classes to an element. For example, if your stylesheet contained
      a helper class named <code>.clearfix</code> you could press
      <code>.</code> inside of the edit text field to see a suggestion list of
      classes and use the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to find the
      <code>.clearfix</code> suggestion. Or type the class name out yourself and

      <kbd>Tab</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Focus moves into an editable
      text field inside of the style inspector. The initial text content of the
      field is the tag name of the element that is selected in the

        The <strong>ARIA Attributes</strong> and
        <strong>Computed Properties</strong> sections are marked up as ARIA
        trees, but they do not currently have focus management so they are not
        keyboard operable.

    <h2 id="audits-panel-audits">Audits panel {: #audits }</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Audits</strong> panel let’s you run a series of tests against
      a site to check for common issues related to performance, accessibility,
      SEO, and a number of other categories.
    </p>

      Configure and run an audit {: #configureaudits }
    </h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        When the <strong>Audits</strong> panel is first opened, focus is placed
        on the <strong>Run Audit</strong> button at the end of the form. By
        default the form is configured to run audits for every category using
        mobile emulation on a simulated 3G connection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or navigate back in Browse mode to
        change the audit settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you’re ready to run the audit, navigate back to the
        <strong>Run Audit</strong> button and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus moves into a modal window with a <strong>Cancel</strong> button
        which allows you to exit the audit. You may hear a series of earcons as
        the audit runs and refreshes the page multiple times.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The different sections of the configuration form are not currently
        marked up with a <code>fieldset</code> element. It may be easier to
        navigate them in Browse mode to figure out which controls are associated
        with each section.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no earcon or live region announcement when the audit is
        finished running. Generally it takes about 30 seconds, after which you
        should be able to navigate to the results. Using Browse mode may be the
        easiest way to reach the results.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="navigate-the-audit-report-auditsnav">

    </h3>
    <p>
      The audit report is organized into sections that correspond with each of
      the audit categories. The report opens with a list of scores for each
      category. These scores are also links which can be used to skip to the
      relevant sections. Within each section are expandable
      <code>details</code> elements, which contain information relating to
      passed or failed audits. By default, only failing audits are shown. Each
      section ends with a final <code>details</code> element which contains all
      of the passed audits.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run a new audit, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to exit the report
      and look for the <strong>Perform An Audit</strong> button.
