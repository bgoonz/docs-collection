<p>This tutorial teaches you how to use Chrome DevTools to find ways to make your websites load faster.</p>
<p>Read on, or watch the video version of this tutorial:</p>
<p>{% YouTube id=“5fLW5Q5ODiE” %}</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-prerequisites">Prerequisites {: #prerequisites }</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should have basic web development experience, similar to what’s taught in this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-development#syllabus">Introduction to Web Development class</a>.</li>
<li>You don’t need to know anything about load performance. You’ll learn about it in this tutorial!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-intro">Introduction {: #intro }</h2>
<p>This is Tony. Tony is very famous in cat society. He has built a website so that his fans can learn what his favorite foods are. His fans love the site, but Tony keeps hearing complaints that the site loads slowly. Tony has asked you to help him speed the site up.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-audit-the-site-audit">Step 1: Audit the site {: #audit }</h2>
<p>Whenever you set out to improve a site’s load performance, <strong>always start with an audit</strong>. The audit has 2 important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a <strong>baseline</strong> for you to measure subsequent changes against.</li>
<li>It gives you <strong>actionable tips</strong> on what changes will have the most impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up-setup">Set up {: #setup }</h3>
<p>But first, you need to set up the site so that you can make changes to it later:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <code>chrome://version</code> to check what version of Chrome you’re using. This tutorial was made with Chrome 68. If you’re using an earlier or later version, some features may look different or not be available. You should be able to complete the tutorial still, just keep in mind that your UI may look different than the screenshots.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tony">Open the source code for the site</a>. This tab will be referred to as the <em>editor tab</em>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/h2JSHSXIa8G3kOqRILbk.png”, alt=“The editor tab.”, width=“800”, height=“457” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>. The editor tab</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>tony</strong>. A menu appears.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/N9c7p2yrUhWgUobkDuVs.png”, alt=“The menu that appears after clicking ‘tony’.”, width=“800”, height=“457” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>. The menu that appears after clicking <strong>tony</strong></p></li>
<li>Click <strong>Remix This</strong>. The name of the project changes from <strong>tony</strong> to some randomly-generated name. You now have your own editable copy of the code. Later on, you’ll make changes to this code.</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Show Live</strong>. The demo opens in a new tab. This tab will be referred to as the <em>demo tab</em>. It may take a while for the site to load.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/2kZXAZgIbvKrafszL6X3.png”, alt=“The demo tab.”, width=“800”, height=“588” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong>. The demo tab</p></li>
<li><p>Press Command+Option+J (Mac) Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS). Chrome DevTools opens up alongside the demo.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/QyoSneXNo8Npiy28nJlU.png”, alt=“DevTools and the demo.”, width=“800”, height=“476” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5</strong>. DevTools and the demo</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the rest of the screenshots in this tutorial, DevTools will be shown as a separate window. You can do this by pressing Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu, typing <code>Undock</code>, and then selecting <strong>Undock into separate window</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="establish-a-baseline-baseline">Establish a baseline {: #baseline }</h3>
<p>The baseline is a record of how the site performed before you made any performance improvements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click the <strong>Audits</strong> tab. It may be hidden behind the <strong>More Panels</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/IxLXhwoZksgzzdzr9OCx.png”, alt=“More Panels”, width=“18”, height=“16” %} button. There’s a Lighthouse on this panel because the project that powers the Audits panel is called <a href="/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/3pLUyTJ93xjvm0itZ3Lb.png”, alt=“The Audits panel.”, width=“800”, height=“1068” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7</strong>. The Audits panel</p></li>
<li><p>Match your audit configuration settings to those in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. Here’s an explanation of the different options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device</strong>. Setting to <strong>Mobile</strong> changes the user agent string and simulates a mobile viewport. Setting to <strong>Desktop</strong> pretty much just disables the <strong>Mobile</strong> changes.</li>
<li><strong>Audits</strong>. Disabling a category prevents the Audits panel from running those audits, and excludes those audits from your report. You can leave the other categories enabled, if you want to see the types of recommendations they provide. Disabling categories slightly speeds up the auditing process.</li>
<li><strong>Throttling</strong>. Setting to <strong>Simulated Fast 3G, 4x CPU Slowdown</strong> simulates the typical conditions of browsing on a mobile device. It’s called “simulated” because the Audits panel doesn’t actually throttle during the auditing process. Instead, it just extrapolates how long the page would take to load under mobile conditions. The <strong>Applied…</strong> setting, on the other hand, actually throttles your CPU and network, with the tradeoff of a longer auditing process.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Storage</strong>. Enabling this checkbox clears all storage associated with the page before every audit. Leave this setting on if you want to audit how first-time visitors experience your site. Disable this setting when you want the repeat-visit experience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Run Audits</strong>. After 10 to 30 seconds, the Audits panel shows you a report of the site’s performance.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="handling-report-errors-errors">Handling report errors {: #errors }</h4>
<p>If you ever get an error in your Audits panel report, try running the demo tab from an <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">incognito window</a> with no other tabs open. This ensures that you’re running Chrome from a clean state. Chrome Extensions in particular often interfere with the auditing process.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 9</strong>. A report that errored</p>
<h3 id="understand-your-report-report">Understand your report {: #report }</h3>
<p>The number at the top of your report is the overall performance score for the site. Later, as you make changes to the code, you should see this number rise. A higher score means better performance.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/V9sAawCdJGzkcYHlGaom.png”, alt=“The overall performance score.”, width=“800”, height=“607” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10</strong>. The overall performance score</p>
<p>The <strong>Metrics</strong> section provides quantitative measurements of the site’s performance. Each metric provides insight into a different aspect of the performance. For example, <strong>First Contentful Paint</strong> tells you when content is first painted to the screen, which is an important milestone in the user’s perception of the page load, whereas <strong>Time To Interactive</strong> marks the point at which the page appears ready enough to handle user interactions.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-experiment-experiment">Step 2: Experiment {: #experiment }</h2>
<p>The Opportunities section of your audit report gives you tips on how to improve the page’s performance. In this section, you implement the recommended changes to the codebase, auditing the site after each change to measure how it affects site speed.</p>
<h3 id="enable-text-compression-compression">Enable text compression {: #compression }</h3>
<p>Your report says that enabling text compression is one of the top opportunities for improving the page’s performance.</p>
<p>Text compression is when you reduce, or compress, the size of a text file before sending it over the network. Kind of like how you might zip a folder before emailing it to reduce its size.</p>
<p>Before you enable compression, here are a couple of ways you can manually check whether text resources are compressed.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click the <strong>Network</strong> tab.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/g11RtVWK4hcRDwj4WGJZ.png”, alt=“The Network panel.”, width=“800”, height=“599” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 19</strong>. The Network panel</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Use Large Request Rows</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/156xToAGxtuF9W5EQ3Ag.png”, alt=“Use Large Request Rows”, width=“28”, height=“20” %}. The height of the rows in the table of network requests increases.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/a5QbfNJhyb20gc9hS6XL.png”, alt=“Large rows in the network requests table.”, width=“800”, height=“607” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 20</strong>. Large rows in the network requests table</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t see the <strong>Size</strong> column in the table of network requests, click the table header and then select <strong>Size</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each <strong>Size</strong> cell shows two values. The top value is the size of the downloaded resource. The bottom value is the size of the uncompressed resource. If the two values are the same, then the resource is not being compressed when it’s sent over the network. For example, in <strong>Figure 20</strong> the top and bottom values for <code>bundle.js</code> are both <code>1.4 MB</code>.</p>
<p>You can also check for compression by inspecting a resource’s HTTP headers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click <strong>bundle.js</strong>.</li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Headers</strong> tab.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/a2tGTXojvtJNXs5jFH8y.png”, alt=“The Headers tab.”, width=“800”, height=“631” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 21</strong>. The Headers tab</p></li>
<li><p>Search the <strong>Response Headers</strong> section for a <code>content-encoding</code> header. You shouldn’t see one, meaning that <code>bundle.js</code> was not compressed. When a resource <em>is</em> compressed, this header is usually set to <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>, or <code>br</code>. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding#Directives">Directives</a> for an explanation of these values.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Enough with the explanations. Time to make some changes! Enable text compression by adding a couple of lines of code:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the editor tab, click <strong>server.js</strong>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/1xABsKdRgfthMK0131pr.png”, alt=“Editing server.js.”, width=“800”, height=“425” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 22</strong>. Editing <code>server.js</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add the following code to <strong>server.js</strong>. Make sure to put <code>app.use(compression())</code> before <code>app.use(express.static('build'))</code>.</p>
<p>… const fs = require(‘fs’); const compression = require(‘compression’); app.use(compression()); app.use(express.static(‘build’)); …</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Usually, you’d have to install the <code>compression</code> package via something like <code>npm i -S compression</code>, but this has already been done for you.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for Glitch to deploy the new build of the site. The fancy animation that you see next to <strong>Logs</strong> and <strong>Show</strong> means that the site is getting rebuilt and redeployed. The change is ready when you see <strong>Show Live</strong> again.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/mmhq1c5QiB0DtICtZKSN.png”, alt=“The animation that indicates that the site is getting built.”, width=“800”, height=“470” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 23</strong>. The animation that indicates that the site is getting built</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the workflows that you learned earlier to manually check that the compression is working:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go back to the demo tab and reload the page. The <strong>Size</strong> column should now show 2 different values for text resources like <code>bundle.js</code>. In <strong>Figure 24</strong> the top value of <code>261 KB</code> for <code>bundle.js</code> is the size of the file that was sent over the network, and the bottom value of <code>1.4 MB</code> is the uncompressed file size.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/F6WaqKTo3NkxzUrGnt7T.png”, alt=“The Size column now shows 2 different values for text resources.”, width=“800”, height=“562” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 24</strong>. The Size column now shows 2 different values for text resources</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Response Headers</strong> section for <code>bundle.js</code> should now include a <code>content-encoding: gzip</code> header.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/2mALWw5969topkCeKfc9.png”, alt=“The Response Headers section now contains a content-encoding header.”, width=“800”, height=“562” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 25</strong>. The Response Headers section now contains a <code>content-encoding</code> header</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Audit the page again to measure what kind of impact text compression has on the page’s load performance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click the <strong>Audits</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Perform an audit</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/9GXCdrHJFoccxgwFYFBm.png”, alt=“Perform an audit”, width=“20”, height=“20” %}.</li>
<li>Leave the settings the same as before.</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Run audit</strong>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/3AAwanwyXAGgYS20JRa9.png”, alt=“An Audits report after enabling text compression.”, width=“800”, height=“631” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 26</strong>. An Audits report after enabling text compression</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Woohoo! That looks like progress. Your overall performance score should have increased, meaning that the site is getting faster.</p>
<h4 id="text-compression-in-the-real-world-real-world-compression">Text compression in the real world {: #real-world-compression }</h4>
<p>Most servers really do have simple fixes like this for enabling compression! Just do a search on how to configure whatever server you use to compress text.</p>
<h3 id="resize-images-images">Resize images {: #images }</h3>
<p>Your new report says that properly sizing images is another big opportunity.</p>
<p>Resizing images helps speed up load time by reducing the file size of images. If your user is viewing your images on a mobile device screen that’s 500-pixels-wide, there’s really no point in sending a 1500-pixel-wide image. Ideally, you’d send a 500-pixel-wided image, at most.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In your report, click <strong>Properly size images</strong> to see what images should be resized. It looks like all 4 images are bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/MQEebrl7WbkRsSQ9Xm4H.png”, alt=“Details about the ‘properly size images’ opportunity.”, width=“800”, height=“533” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 27</strong>. Details about the <em>Properly size images</em> opportunity</p></li>
<li>Back in the editor tab, open <code>src/model.js</code>.</li>
<li>Replace <code>const dir = 'big'</code> with <code>const dir = 'small'</code>. This directory contains copies of the same images which have been resized.</li>
<li><p>Audit the page again to see how this change affects load performance.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/ln4bwb1bVEIgnR9pNb32.png”, alt=“An Audits report after resizing images.”, width=“800”, height=“573” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 28</strong>. An Audits report after resizing images</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Looks like the change only has a minor affect on the overall performance score. However, one thing that the score doesn’t show clearly is how much network data you’re saving your users. The total size of the old photos was around 5.3 megabytes, whereas now it’s only about 0.18 megabytes.</p>
<h4 id="resizing-images-in-the-real-world-real-world-resizing">Resizing images in the real world {: #real-world-resizing }</h4>
<p>For a small app, doing a one-off resize like this may be good enough. But for a large app, this obviously isn’t scalable. Here are some strategies for managing images in large apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resize images during your build process.</li>
<li>Create multiple sizes of each image during the build process and then use <code>srcset</code> in your code. At runtime, the browser takes care of choosing what size is best for the device it’s running on. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/images#relative_sized_images">Relative-sized images</a>.</li>
<li>Use an image CDN that lets you dynamically resize an image when you request it.</li>
<li>At the very least, optimize each image. This can often create huge savings. Optimization is when you run an image through a special program that reduces the size of the image file. See <a href="https://images.guide/">Essential Image Optimization</a> for more tips.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eliminate-render-blocking-resources-render">Eliminate render-blocking resources {: #render }</h3>
<p>Your latest report says that eliminating render-blocking resources is now the biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>A render-blocking resource is an external JavaScript or CSS file that the browser must download, parse, and execute before it can show the page. The goal is to only run the core CSS and JavaScript code that is required to display the page properly.</p>
<p>The first task, then, is to find code that doesn’t need to be executed on page load.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click <strong>Eliminate render-blocking resources</strong> to see the resources that are blocking: <code>lodash.js</code> and <code>jquery.js</code>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/30KsfDd87y7S1Tx7KsdY.png”, alt=“More information about the ‘reduce render-blocking resources’ opportunity.”, width=“800”, height=“470” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 29</strong>. More information about the <em>Reduce render-blocking resources</em> opportunity</p></li>
<li><p>Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu, start typing <code>Coverage</code>, and then select <strong>Show Coverage</strong>.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/Cy7cW3nb11D7A2ndQcsS.png”, alt=“Opening the Command Menu from the Audits panel.”, width=“800”, height=“438” %}</p>

<li><p>Click <strong>Reload</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/sUKAx2esbJbYN6Ti3K8j.png”, alt=“Reload”, width=“24”, height=“25” %}. The Coverage tab provides an overview of how much of the code in <code>bundle.js</code>, <code>jquery.js</code>, and <code>lodash.js</code> is being executed while the page loads. <strong>Figure 32</strong> says that about 76% and 30% of the jQuery and Lodash files aren’t used, respectively.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/QmkjKS7ovEnvxmOwdva0.png”, alt=“The Coverage report.”, width=“800”, height=“565” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 32</strong>. The Coverage report</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>jquery.js</strong> row. DevTools opens the file in the Sources panel. A line of code was executed if it has a green bar next to it. A red bar means it was not executed, and is definitely not needed on page load.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/xiqQiVD1TIga3vAjhOTp.png”, alt=“Viewing the jQuery file in the Sources panel.”, width=“800”, height=“727” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 33</strong>. Viewing the jQuery file in the Sources panel</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll through the jQuery code a bit. Some of the lines that get “executed” are actually just comments. Running this code through a minifier that strips comments is another way to reduce the size of this file.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, when you’re working with your own code, the Coverage tab can help you analyze your code, line-by-line, and only ship the code that’s needed for page load.</p>
<p>Are the <code>jquery.js</code> and <code>lodash.js</code> files even needed to load the page? The Request Blocking tab can show you what happens when resources aren’t available.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click the <strong>Network</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to open the Command Menu again.</li>
<li><p>Start typing <code>blocking</code> and then select <strong>Show Request Blocking</strong>.</p>

<li><p>Click <strong>Add Pattern</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/VxE1QVPuOBQU1jNi6daa.png”, alt=“Add Pattern”, width=“20”, height=“20” %}, type <code>/libs/*</code>, and then press Enter to confirm.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 35</strong>. Adding a pattern to block any request to the <code>libs</code> directory</p></li>
<li><p>Reload the page. The jQuery and Lodash requests are red, meaning that they were blocked. The page still loads and is interactive, so it looks like these resources aren’t needed whatsoever!</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/6uapC5Z2q18AdsytxmLY.png”, alt=“The Network panel shows that the requests have been blocked.”, width=“800”, height=“649” %}</p>

<li><p>Click <strong>Remove all patterns</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/68qlmwDuexzRmvlmENsm.png”, alt=“Remove all patterns”, width=“26”, height=“26” %} to delete the <code>/libs/*</code> blocking pattern.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, the Request Blocking tab is useful for simulating how your page behaves when any given resource isn’t available.</p>
<p>Now, remove the references to these files from the code and audit the page again:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Back in the editor tab, open <code>template.html</code>.</li>
<li>Delete <code>&lt;script src="/libs/lodash.js"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src="/libs/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Wait for the site to re-build and re-deploy.</li>
<li><p>Audit the page again from the <strong>Audits</strong> panel. Your overall score should have improved again.</p>

<h4 id="optimizing-the-critical-rendering-path-in-the-real-world-crp">Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path in the real-world {: #crp }</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path">Critical Rendering Path</a> refers to the code that you need to load a page. In general, you can speed up page load by only shipping critical code during the page load, and then lazy-loading everything else.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unlikely that you’ll find scripts that you can remove outright, but you will often find that many scripts don’t need to be requested during the page load, and can instead be requested asynchronously. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript#use_async_or_defer">Using async or defer</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using a framework, check if it has a production mode. This mode may use a feature such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree shaking</a> in order to eliminate unnecessary code that is blocking the critical render.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-less-main-thread-work-main">Do less main thread work {: #main }</h3>
<p>Your latest report shows some minor potential savings in the Opportunities section, but if you look down in the Diagnostics section, it looks like the biggest bottleneck is too much main thread activity.</p>
<p>The main thread is where the browser does most of the work needed to display a page, such as parsing and executing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The goal is to use the Performance panel to analyze what work the main thread is doing while the page loads, and find ways to defer or remove unnecessary work.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click the <strong>Performance</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Capture Settings</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/II9FuwvOLWrZAaaPOKTL.png”, alt=“Capture Settings”, width=“28”, height=“28” %}.</li>
<li>Set <strong>Network</strong> to <strong>Slow 3G</strong> and <strong>CPU</strong> to <strong>6x slowdown</strong>. Mobile devices typically have more hardware constraints than laptops or desktops, so these settings let you experience the page load as if you were using a less powerful device.</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Reload</strong> {% Img src=“image/admin/sUKAx2esbJbYN6Ti3K8j.png”, alt=“Reload”, width=“24”, height=“25” %}. DevTools reloads the page and then produces a visualization of all it had to do in order to load the page. This visualization will be referred to as the <em>trace</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 38</strong>. The Performance panel’s trace of the page load</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The trace shows activity chronologically, from left to right. The FPS, CPU, and NET charts at the top give you an overview of frames per second, CPU activity, and network activity. The wall of yellow that you see in <strong>Figure 39</strong> means that the CPU was completely busy with scripting activity. This is a clue that you may be able to speed up page load by doing less JavaScript work.</p>

<p>Investigate the trace to find ways to do less JavaScript work:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click the <strong>User Timing</strong> section to expand it. Based on the fact that there seems to be a bunch of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API">User Timing</a> measures from React, it seems like Tony’s app is using the development mode of React. Switching to the production mode of React will probably yield some easy performance wins.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 40</strong>. The User Timing section</p></li>
<li>Click <strong>User Timing</strong> again to collapse that section.</li>
<li><p>Browse the <strong>Main</strong> section. This section shows a chronological log of main thread activity, from left to right. The y-axis (top to bottom) shows why events occurred. For example, in <strong>Figure 41</strong>, the <code>Evaluate Script</code> event caused the <code>(anonymous)</code> function to execute, which caused <code>../rbd/pnpm-volume/...</code> to execute, which caused <code>__webpack__require__</code> to execute, and so on.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/vfnYkoiAVM61wxyXIbXc.png”, alt=“The Main section”, width=“800”, height=“609” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 41</strong>. The Main section</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Main</strong> section. When you use a framework, most of the upper activity is caused by the framework, which is usually out of your control. The activity caused by your app is usually at the bottom. In this app, it seems like a function called <code>App</code> is causing a lot of calls to a <code>mineBitcoin</code> function. It sounds like Tony might be using the devices of his fans to mine cryptocurrency…</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/admin/UmtH1RZihmBQxNcmVtE3.png”, alt=“Hovering over the mineBitcoin activity.”, width=“800”, height=“512” %}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 42</strong>. Hovering over the <code>mineBitcoin</code> activity</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the calls that your framework makes are usually out of your control, sometimes you may structure your app in a way that causes the framework to run inefficiently. Restructuring your app to use the framework efficiently can be a way to do less main thread work. However, this requires a deep understanding of how your framework works, and what kind of changes you can make in your own code in order to use the framework more efficiently.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the <strong>Bottom-Up</strong> section. This tab breaks down what activities took up the most time. If you don’t see anything in the Bottom-Up section, click the label for <strong>Main</strong> section. The Bottom-Up section only shows information for whatever activity, or group of activity, you have currently selected. For example, if you clicked on one of the <code>mineBitcoin</code> activities, the Bottom-Up section is only going to show information for that one activity.</p>

</ol>
<p>The <strong>Self Time</strong> column shows you how much time was spent directly in each activity. For example, <strong>Figure 43</strong> shows that about 57% of main thread time was spent on the <code>mineBitcoin</code> function.</p>
<p>Time to see whether using production mode and reducing JavaScript activity will speed up the page load. Start with production mode:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the editor tab, open <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</li>
<li>Change <code>"mode":"development"</code> to <code>"mode":"production"</code>.</li>
<li>Wait for the new build to deploy.</li>
<li><p>Audit the page again.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 44</strong>. An Audits report after configuring webpack to use production mode</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Reduce JavaScript activity by removing the call to <code>mineBitcoin</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the editor tab, open <code>src/App.jsx</code>.</li>
<li>Comment out the call to <code>this.mineBitcoin(1500)</code> in the <code>constructor</code>.</li>
<li>Wait for the new build to deploy.</li>
<li><p>Audit the page again.</p>

<p>In general, the Performance panel is the most common way to understand what activity your site does as it loads, and find ways to remove unnecessary activity.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer an approach that feels more like <code>console.log()</code>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API">User Timing</a> API lets you arbitrarily mark up certain phases of your app lifecycle, in order to track how long each of those phases takes.</p>
