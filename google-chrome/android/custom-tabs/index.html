      App developers face a choice when a user taps a URL to either launch a
      browser, or build their own in-app browser using WebViews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both options present challenges - launching the browser is a heavy context
      switch for users that isn’t customizable, while WebViews
      <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46739/">don’t support</a> all
      features of the web platform, don’t share state with the browser and add
      maintenance overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom Tabs is a browser feature,
      <a
        href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/09/chrome-custom-tabs-smooth-transition.html"
        >introduced by Chrome</a
      >, that is now supported by most major browsers on Android. It give apps
      more control over their web experience, and make transitions between
      native and web content more seamless without having to resort to a
      WebView.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: For information on sharing the content in Custom Tabs, see the blog
      post,
      <a
        href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/better-content-sharing-with-custom-tabs.html"
        >Better content sharing with Custom Tabs</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom Tabs allow an app to customize how the browser looks and feels. An
      app can change things like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Toolbar color</li>
      <li>Enter and exit animations</li>
      <li>
        Add custom actions to the browser toolbar, overflow menu and bottom
        toolbar
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Custom Tabs also allow the developer to pre-start the browser and
      pre-fetch content for faster loading.
    </p>
    <p>

      When should I use Custom Tabs vs WebView?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The WebView is good solution if you are hosting your own content inside
      your app. If your app directs people to URLs outside your domain, we
      recommend that you use Custom Tabs for these reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Support for the same web platform features and capabilities as the
        browsers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple to implement. No need to build code to manage requests,
        permission grants or cookie stores.
      </li>
      <li>
        UI customization:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Toolbar color
            <ul>
              <li>Action button</li>
              <li>Custom menu items</li>
              <li>Custom in/out animations</li>
              <li>Bottom toolbar</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigation awareness: the browser delivers a callback to the application
        upon an external navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security: the browser uses Google’s Safe Browsing to protect the user
        and the device from dangerous sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance optimization:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pre-warming of the Browser in the background, while avoiding
            stealing resources from the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing a likely URL in advance to the browser, which may perform
            speculative work, speeding up page load time.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Lifecycle management: the browser prevents the application from being
        evicted by the system while on top of it, by raising its importance to
        the “foreground” level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shared cookie jar and permissions model so users don’t have to sign-in
        to sites they are already connected to, or re-grant permissions they
        have already granted.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user has turned on Data Saver, they will still benefit from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Synchronized AutoComplete across devices for better form completion.
      </li>
      <li>Simple customization model.</li>
      <li>Quickly return to app with a single tap.</li>
      <li>
        You want to use the latest browser implementations on devices
        pre-Lollipop (auto updating WebView) instead of older WebViews.
      </li>
    </ul>

      extend the Custom Tabs protocol and shares most of its benefits. But,
      instead of providing a customized UI, it allows developers to open a
      browser tab without any UI at all. It is recommended for developers who
      want to open their own

      Custom Tabs is a feature supported by browsers on the Android platform. It

      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome"
        >Chrome</a
      >, on version 45. Currently, the protocol is supported by most Android
