<ul>
<li>Adtech platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_platform">demand-side platforms</a> (DSP) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management_platform">data management platforms</a> (DMP) may use this API to support functionality that currently relies on third-party cookies.</li>
<li>Advertisers and publishers relying on custom code for advertising or conversion measurement may use this API to replace existing techniques.</li>
<li>Advertisers and publishers relying on adtech platforms for conversion measurement don’t need to use the API directly, but may be interested in understanding it if they’re working with adtech platforms that may integrate the API.</li>

<h2 id="why-is-this-api-needed-why-is-this-api-needed">Why is this API needed? {: #why-is-this-api-needed }</h2>
<p>Today, ad conversion measurement often relies on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Third-party_cookies">third-party cookies</a>. Browsers are restricting access to third-party cookies because these can be used to track users across sites and hinder user privacy. This API enables those measurements in a privacy-preserving way, without third-party cookies.</p>

<p>{% Aside %} This API is being incubated and developed in the open. It is subject to change. Your feedback is welcome. See <a href="#engage">how to engage</a>. {% endAside %}</p>
<p>The Attribution Reporting API enables the measurement of two events that are linked together: an event on a publisher’s website, such as a user viewing or clicking an ad, with a subsequent conversion on an advertiser site.</p>
<p>This API supports click-through conversion attribution measurement (available in the first implementation of this API, currently in <a href="https://web.dev/conversion-measurement/#browser-support">origin trial</a>) and view-through attribution measurement (<a href="https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/event_attribution_reporting_views.md">see public explainer</a>).</p>
<p>The API offers two types of attribution reports than can be used for different use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event-level reports</strong> associate a particular ad click or view (on the ad side) with data on the conversion side. To preserve user privacy by preventing the joining of user identity across sites, conversion-side data is very limited, and the data is ‘noised’ (meaning that for a small percentage of cases, random data is sent). As an extra privacy protection, reports are not sent immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate reports</strong> are not tied with a specific event on the ad side. These reports provide richer, higher-fidelity conversion data than event-level reports. A combination of privacy techniques across cryptography, distribution of trust, and differential privacy help reduce the risk of identity joining across sites. Both report types can be used simultaneously. They’re complementary. Other features that are designed in this API include <a href="https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/cross_device.md">cross-device attribution reporting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/app_to_web.md">app-to-web attribution reporting</a>.</li>
