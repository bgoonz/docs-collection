<p>This page has advice on how you should implement your app and list it in the store. As the store matures and we learn from developers’ experiences, these recommendations will be updated.</p>
<h2 id="design-a-high-quality-extension">Design a high-quality extension</h2>
<p>We encourage you to develop extensions that are of high quality. High-quality extensions conform to standards of performance, security, and user experience, as summarized by the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compliance:</strong> Does the extension comply with our <a href="/docs/webstore/program_policies/">program policies</a>? Extensions must not violate any of these policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manifest V3:</strong> Is the extension built on Manifest V3? Manifest V3 is the current version of the Chrome extension platform and all High Quality extensions should use it. (See the <a href="/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/">Manifest V3 overview</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Is the extension safe for users? Make sure your extension does not pose security threats and does not use deceptive installation tactics (see <a href="/docs/extensions/mv3/security/">Stay secure</a> for a more in-depth discussion.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User privacy:</strong> Make sure that your extension handles user data appropriately and conforms to Chrome Web Store’s data privacy requirements. (See this <a href="/docs/webstore/user_data/">FAQ</a> for further details.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Does the extension function at an outstanding level? High-quality extensions don’t just perform their intended action, they do so while using as few system resources as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User experience:</strong> Is the extension a joy to use? The extension itself should provide a good-looking, intuitive, and seamless user experience while also respecting the end user’s privacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Store listing:</strong> The extension’s <a href="/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-listing/">Chrome Web Store listing</a> should set the user’s expectations and clearly communicate what the extension does. All image assets (icon, tile, marquee, and screenshots) <a href="/docs/webstore/images/">should be provided</a>. Images should not be blurry or too busy. <a href="/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-privacy/">Privacy information</a> (permissions justifications, the extension’s privacy policy, data use disclosures, etc.) must be accurate and up to date.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="support-google-accounts">Support Google Accounts</h2>
<p>If your app requires user login, we recommend that you provide at least some support for Google Accounts. The reason is that if a user purchases your app from the Chrome Web Store, odds are the user is already logged into a Google Account whenever they use your app. Reducing the number of logins improves the user’s experience.</p>
<p>If you already have a login system, consider correlating the Google Account ID to the user account in your system. You can do this by storing the user’s OpenID URL from Google’s OpenID service, in the same way that you store other data that’s associated with a user’s account. When someone is logged into a Google Account but not your login system, you can automatically log them into their user account in your system.</p>
<p>See <a href="/docs/webstore/identify_user">Identifying the User</a> for more information about supporting Google Accounts.</p>
<h2 id="keep-ex-users-data-for-30-days-or-more">Keep ex-users’ data for 30 days or more</h2>
<p>You should keep users’ data for at least 30 days after they cancel their subscription or uninstall your app. Users might be unsubscribed for reasons beyond their control, and even if they do intentionally unsubscribe or uninstall the app, they might come back.</p>
<h2 id="cache-license-data">Cache license data</h2>
<p>If you use a payment processor or other licensing manager, you may also want to cache the results so that <strong>(a)</strong> Your user can still use the extension when they are offline, and <strong>(b)</strong> you reduce the number of queries to the license server, reducing quota usage and traffic.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-compelling-store-listing">Create a compelling store listing</h2>
<p>The better your app’s listing in the store, the more users will find and try your app. When choosing your app’s name, writing its description, and designing its logo, keep in mind Google’s <a href="/docs/webstore/branding">Branding Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more, see <a href="/docs/webstore/best_listing/">Creating a great listing page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="provide-great-images">Provide great images</h3>
<p>See <a href="/docs/webstore/images">Supplying Images</a> for guidelines on the images you should supply to the store.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-apps-category-well">Choose your app’s category well</h3>
<p>The developer console lets you specify a category for each extension. Choose the category that is most appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Developer Tools</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>News &amp; Weather</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
<li>Search Tools</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Social &amp; Communication</li>
<li>Sports</li>
</ul>
