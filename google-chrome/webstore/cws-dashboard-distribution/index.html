<p>In the Payment and Distribution tab you can declare if your extension is free or contains in-app purchases. You can also choose who will see it on the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/QQZihsAu4qF7vKH7n648.png”, alt=“Screenshot of the Chrome Web Store payment and distribution page”, width=“800”, height=“388” %}</p>
<h2 id="declaring-in-app-purchases-in-app-purchases">Declaring in-app purchases {: #in-app-purchases }</h2>
<p>If you plan to use a third party service to offer additional paid features or subscriptions, choose <strong>Contains in-app purchases</strong>. This option will display an “in-app purchases” badge on your extension’s detail page.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-visibility-setting-the-visibility">Setting the visibility {: #setting-the-visibility }</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Visibility</strong> settings to configure who can see your item in the Chrome Web Store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>—This option lists your item on the Chrome Web Store for all users to see and install.</li>
<li><strong>Unlisted</strong>—This option does not create a listing on the Chrome Web Store, but does allows anyone to install your item if they know its Chrome Web Store URL.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>—This option limits installation of your item to specified users only. This is typically used for testing before public launch of an item.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% Aside ‘gotchas’ %} All visibility settings have the same policy requirements and will go through the same review process. {% endAside %}</p>
<h3 id="private-visibility-trusted-testers-private-visibility-trusted-testers">Private visibility: Trusted testers {: #private-visibility-trusted-testers }</h3>
<p>Private allows your trusted testers to install the item. You designate trusted testers by listing them on your Chrome Web Store account home page.</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>The trusted testers list is associated with your <em>account</em>, and not an individual item. To create multiple trusted tester accounts, you must use separate accounts. However, you can also <a href="#private-visibility-google-groups">add groups</a> to your private listing, on a per-item basis.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows some trusted tester accounts listed in a Chrome Web Store developer account page:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/SrVxYFc0lmMgXxtN30gA.png”, alt=“Screenshot showing trusted tester accounts listed in a Chrome Web Store developer account page”, height=“395”, width=“800” %}</p>
<h3 id="private-visibility-google-groups-private-visibility-google-groups">Private visibility: Google Groups {: #private-visibility-google-groups }</h3>
<p>In addition to your trusted tester accounts, you can also include any Google Groups that you own or manage:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/oTlA3I2z8qNRiqSj9T2j.png”, alt=“Screenshot showing groups added to private visibility”, height=“520”, width=“800” %}</p>
<p>Any members of the specified groups, along with your trusted testers, will be able to install the item.</p>
<h3 id="private-visibility-domain-publishing-private-visibility-domain-publish">Private visibility: domain publishing {: #private-visibility-domain-publish }</h3>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>This feature is only available for Google Workspace domains where it has been enable by the domain administrator.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<p>If domain publishing is enabled for your organization, an additional option appears in the distribution page of the developer console:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/zpV6tBHuf3HLBpRjGsNA.png”, alt=“Screenshot showing the domain publishing option in the developer console”, width=“643”, height=“200”, class=“screenshot” %}</p>
<p>See <a href="/docs/webstore/cws-enterprise/">Enterprise publishing options</a> for an overview of this and other enterprise extension topics, along with links to other enterprise extension documentation.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-geographic-distribution-setting-the-geographic-distribution">Setting the geographic distribution {: #setting-the-geographic-distribution }</h2>
<p>The <strong>Distribution</strong> setting lets you specify which geographic areas will see your item listing in the Chrome Web Store. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>All regions</strong> to display your item to the entire world.</li>
<li>Select individual countries to publish to—this is useful for items with a regional focus or relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you publish to the world, your item will be immediately visible to the region(s) you select, and it’ll be visible in the store’s search results.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-a-test-version">Publishing a test version</h2>
<p>You can publish a “BETA” or “TESTING” version to the Chrome Web Store in parallel with a production version. It can be listed private, unlisted or public. After addressing issues and bugs based on user feedback, you can publish a revised version of your extension to the rest of your users.</p>
<p>Before you submit a testing version to the Chrome Web Store, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add the label “DEVELOPMENT BUILD” or “BETA” at the end of the name of your extension.</li>
<li>Declare the purpose of your extension in the description: “THIS EXTENSION IS FOR BETA TESTING”.</li>
</ol>
<p>{% Aside ‘warning’ %}</p>
<p>Make sure to add these labels. If you don’t, then both extensions may be taken down. For more information, see <a href="/docs/webstore/spam-faq/#repetitive-content">Repetitive Content Spam Policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-ready-to-submit-this-item">You are ready to submit this item!</h2>
<p>After filling out the <a href="/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-listing/">Listing</a> tab and the <a href="/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-privacy/">Privacy</a> tab, you can now <a href="/docs/webstore/publish/#publish-item">publish your item</a>.</p>
