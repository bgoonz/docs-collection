<p>This page describes how to manage an extension or theme (“item”) that was previously submitted to the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-lifecycle-of-an-item-in-the-chrome-web-store">About the lifecycle of an item in the Chrome Web Store</h2>
<p>All Chrome Web Store items go through an automated review process. In some instances a manual review is required, especially when sensitive permissions are requested. For this reason review times and/or approval times can take longer. Since a Chrome Web Store item goes through several stages, it’s important to keep track of your item’s status. See the lifecycle diagram below:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/yakIoAzWEchO8urosQLs.png”, alt=“Diagram of lifecycle of a Chrome Web Store item”, width=“800”, height=“177” %}</p>
<h2 id="check-your-items-status">Check your item’s status</h2>
<p>The status of your item appears in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole">developer dashboard</a> next to each item. The status can be Published, Pending, Rejected, or Taken Down.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/bUbtISU01bab8WyWqonX.png”, alt=“Developer dashboard status types”, width=“800”, height=“221” %}</p>
<p>To stay informed of your item’s status, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enable email notifications</strong>. There are mandatory emails like take down or rejection notifications that are enabled by default. To receive notification when you item is published or staged, you can enable email notifications in the Account page.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/FgPIwRl3QEbNowNV1zRn.png”, alt=“How to enable email notifications”, width=“658”, height=“219” %}</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check your publisher email</strong>. After enabling email notifications check your inbox often. To ensure that CWS emails don’t get flagged as Spam, add <strong>chromewebstore-noreply@google.com</strong> to your contacts so that you receive all communications in a timely manner.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comply-with-chrome-web-store-policies">Comply with Chrome Web Store policies</h2>
<p>To ensure a positive experience for your users follow the <a href="/docs/webstore/program_policies">developer program policies</a>. These policies may change, so check the <a href="/docs/extensions/whatsnew/">new announcements</a> page frequently.</p>
<p>If your extension has been determined to violate one or more terms or policies, you will receive an email notification that contains the violation description and instructions on how to rectify. You can also find this information in the Status tab of your item.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/C4wpnEeMriI9YeDAMDIr.png”, alt=“The Chrome Web Store Status Tab”, width=“700”, height=“276” %}</p>
<p>If you have been informed about a violation and you do not rectify your item will be taken down.</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>To request further clarification on the reasons for the take down or appeal the decision contact <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/contact/dev_account_transfer">Chrome Web Store Developer Support</a>. For more examples and instructions on how you can remedy the problem check the <a href="/docs/webstore/troubleshooting/">Troubleshooting guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improve-ratings-and-reply-to-user-reviews">Improve ratings and reply to user reviews</h2>
<p>Ratings and reviews help people decide whether or not to try out an extension. Not only do they leave a positive impression, but can also increase your ranking on the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>Users can leave comments in the <strong>Reviews tab</strong> of your store item; you can also post replies here to those reviews. Each user can only rate an extension once, but they can update their rating or review at any time. You can edit your reply at any time to provide the user with updates.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/M09XcAQmPi1dS84EiVQo.png”, alt=“Store item reviews tab”, width=“600”, height=“201” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>Users will not be notified when you reply to a review, but other users will see that you are committed to solving issues as they arise.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<p>Users are more likely to improve their review if you respond and address their concerns promptly. To receive email notifications when users post reviews or update existing reviews, you can enable Item Reviews in the <strong>Account settings</strong> of the Developer Dashboard.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/8KGlMCKpiVVBRVqPAkXF.png”, alt=“Enable reviews notifications”, width=“600”, height=“212” %}</p>
<p>The <strong>Rating tab</strong> in the developer dashboard provides an overview of your extension’s ratings, including the total number of reviews and ratings over time.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/HXJU5d5hEtHNNgj7aehv.png”, alt=“Dashboard Ratings tab”, width=“600”, height=“408” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>You can give users a direct link to the review page of your store item by adding <code>/reviews</code> at the end of your item’s URL: <code>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/{your-item-id}/reviews</code></p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<h2 id="provide-user-support">Provide user support</h2>
<p>To ensure the best user experience and build a great extension it’s important to collect, evaluate, and follow up on user feedback. You can manage your extension’s user feedback in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using the built in CWS User Support tab, or</li>
<li>By using a dedicated support site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users will be able to communicate with you using the <strong>Support</strong> tab of your store item.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/OBDYk7n5dBcaqs3z1HtL.png”, alt=“Store item Support tab”, width=“800”, height=“121” %}</p>
<h3 id="using-the-user-support-tab-user-support-tab">Using the User Support tab {: #user-support-tab }</h3>
<p>First, you must enable user feedback in the developer console Account setting page.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/ArMfJztL1OlP6UektUwb.png”, alt=“Enable User Feedback Support tab”, width=“800”, height=“185” %}</p>
<p>In the <strong>User Support</strong> tab of the developer console you can view, respond and manage user feedback. Use the <strong>Type</strong> dropdown to filter user input by feature request, bug report or question. You can assign a status to each request, and can respond to each inquiry. Each ticket includes the extension version, browser type and operating system to help you reproduce bugs more efficiently.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/VvJFAHdrcMnUivTLm0kK.png”, alt=“Dashboard User Support Tab”, width=“800”, height=“269” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %} Currently, this feature does not provide notifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will not be notified when a user posts a new request.</li>
<li>The user will not be notified when you post a response.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<h3 id="using-a-dedicated-support-site-dedicated-support-site">Using a dedicated support site {: #dedicated-support-site }</h3>
<p>You can set up a dedicated support site for your users, so that the support link goes there instead of the default forum experience. This site can be anything you like, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discussion group using Google Groups or some similar service.</li>
<li>A form-handling site that lets users submit feedback or support tickets.</li>
<li>A public information site with your product road map or other details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you set up the site, go to the <strong>Store Listing</strong> tab of the developer console and add the link to the <strong>Support URL</strong> field. Your support link will then take users to your dedicated site.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/7R8GYtBJjjRy1ih20dGd.png”, alt=“Store Listing Support URL field”, width=“514”, height=“283” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>Make sure you <strong>turn off</strong> the <a href="#user-support-tab">User Feedback</a> in the dashboard Account settings to disable the default support experience.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<h2 id="track-your-store-listing-performance">Track your store listing performance</h2>
<p>Understanding your Chrome Web Store listing metrics can help you evaluate how changes to your store listing have affected conversion rates. For example, you can identify countries with a high number of visitors so you can prioritize internationalization of your extension for those countries. You can also export all the reports described below as CSV files.</p>
<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>
<p>The impressions metrics track the number of users that discover your extension while searching or browsing the Chrome Web Store. An impression occurs when your extension is featured in any collection or direct visits to your store item.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/Hu4dskyv3lIOuYB0qpv0.png”, alt=“daily impressions statistics chart”, width=“800”, height=“299” %}</p>
<h3 id="daily-installs-and-uninstalls">Daily installs and uninstalls</h3>
<p>You can track customer acquisition and churn using these reports: - Track acquisition using the daily install report. - Monitor user churn using the daily uninstalls analytics.</p>
<p>These numbers include new and returning users. You can configure this data by country, language, operating system, or time period using the “filter by” dropdown menus.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/bj6IRC7am3XgQwcfxpnr.png”, alt=“daily installs statistics chart”, width=“800”, height=“586” %}</p>
<h3 id="weekly-users">Weekly users</h3>
<p>You can monitor weekly user retention for different groups of users, categorized by country, language, operating system, and item version.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/jOUcBDD8sBcTFCXrGq1s.png”, alt=“weekly users statistics chart”, width=“800”, height=“342” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>The <strong>Weekly Users</strong> stats only captures installations; it doesn’t monitor whether users are active or not.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>To use Google Analytics to track Store item metrics, you can add your Google Analytics ID in the <strong>Store listing Tab</strong> under Additional fields.</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/nYdeRcgteYZL6pTyPQMA.png”, alt=“where to add google analytics id”, width=“787”, height=“121” %}</p>
