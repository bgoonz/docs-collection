This page describes how to delete a CWS account—either a developer or group publisher account.

About account deletion {: \#about-account-deletion }
----------------------------------------------------

Items in the Chrome Web Store are associated with developer and publisher accounts. There are a few things you need to understand before you delete an account:

-   Account deletion is permanent. There is no “undo” for this action.
-   You can’t delete an account that still has published items. If you have published items, make sure to [unpublish](/docs/webstore/faq/#faq-listing-03) them before you try and delete the account.
-   Group publisher accounts can only be deleted by the owner or manager of the associated Google Group.

How to delete a developer account {: \#how-to-delete-a-developer-account }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To delete a developer account, first make sure you’ve [unpublished](/docs/webstore/faq/#faq-listing-03) any published items. Then, go to your account page on the Chrome Web Store [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole). Scroll down to the **Developer Account** section:

How to delete a group publisher account {: \#how-to-delete-a-group-publisher-account }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To delete a [group publisher](/docs/webstore/group-publishers/) account, select it using the “Publisher” pulldown at the top of the account page, then proceed as described above. Make sure that you have [unpublished](/docs/webstore/faq/#faq-listing-03) any items associated with the group publisher account.

With the group publisher account selected, you’ll see a **Group publisher account** section:
