<p>Before you can publish items on the Chrome Web Store, you must register as a CWS developer and pay a one-time registration fee. You must provide a developer email when you create your developer account; here are some tips about which email to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because you will receive important emails about your extension or you may want to delete one of your accounts, we suggest using a new email account just for publishing your Chrome Web Store items.</li>
<li>Make sure to check this address frequently so that you’re aware of any important alerts or announcements.</li>
<li>If you recently <a href="/docs/webstore/account-deletion/">deleted your Chrome Web Store developer account</a>, you can’t reuse its associated email identity to create a new one. {% Aside ‘warning’ %} If you requested the deletion of your account by mistake, please <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/contact/one_stop_support">contact developer support</a> immediately. {% endAside %}</li>
</ul>
<p>To register, just access the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole">developer console</a>. The first time you do this, the following registration screen will appear. First agree to the developer agreement and policies then pay the registration fee.</p>

<p>Once you pay the registration fee and agree to the terms, you will not see this registration page again.</p>
