<h1 class="title">Creating a great listing page</h1>
<p class="date">2021-08-10</p>
</header>
<p>The Chrome Web Store works hard to help users discover and install quality items. Making sure yours is a “quality item” can help ensure its prominence in the store, potentially increasing your user base.</p>
<p>Our focus on surfacing quality items to users encompases the entire user experience—this includes the store listing page. Build trust with users by making a strong first impression, with a compelling and accurate store listing page. A quality listing page clearly communicates what your item will offer, using the item description, images, and other listing metadata. You can build and maintain your store listing page using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole">developer dashboard</a>.</p>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<p>There are two main text resources that you can use to make your listing compelling: The <em>item summary</em> and the <em>item description</em>. The following sections explain how to make best use of these text fields.</p>
<h3 id="item-summary">Item summary</h3>
<p>Your summary is used to give an overview of your item in a concise phrase (132 characters or less). This is the main description of your item users see from the homepage, category pages and in search results. Ensure the most important text is included in your summary to help users understand what they can expect from your item in a quick glance.</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘better’ %} Highlight features of your item that resonate with your audience’s main use cases. {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘worse’ %} Include generic descriptions like “best extension ever”. {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %} The summary is a plain text string (no HTML or other formatting) that describes the extension. The description should be suitable for both the browser’s extension management UI and the Chrome Web Store. You can specify locale-specific strings for this field; see <a href="/docs/extensions/reference/i18n/">Internationalization</a> for details. {% endAside %}</p>
<h3 id="item-description">Item description</h3>
<p>Your item description is intended to give users a more in-depth overview of the main features and capabilities of your item. Item descriptions appear on the item listing page, underneath the screenshots. Make your descriptions concise, informative, and accurate, using more than just one sentence. The ideal format is an overview paragraph followed by a short list of main features. Let users know why they’ll love it. Avoid typos and symbols that commonly distract the user.</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘better’ %} Focus on the keywords that represent the most important features of your extension. {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘worse’ %} Add unnecessary keywords to your description in an attempt to improve search results. Repetitive or irrelevant use of keywords can create an unpleasant user experience and result in an item being suspended from the Chrome Web Store. {% endCompare %}</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The graphical assets that appear in your listing are the <em>store icon</em>, <em>screenshots</em>, and your <em>promotional images</em>. The following sections provide guidance for how you can best use these assets to provide a high-quality, compelling store listing.</p>
<h3 id="store-icon">Store icon</h3>
<p>Your item’s icon is one of the first elements of your item that users see when they are on your store listing page. Use an icon that is simple and recognizable to your brand. Most often, this will simply be the brand or developer logo. Ensure your icon follows our <a href="/docs/webstore/images/#extension-icon">extension icon best practices</a>.</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘better’ %} Keep it simple, and use colors and design elements that are consistent with the branding of your other assets. {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘worse’ %} Include screenshots or UI elements. These details can be very hard to see in small sizes. {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>See more examples of icons that follow the correct guidelines on the <a href="/docs/webstore/images/#extension-icon">extension icon best practices</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3>
<p>Use screenshots (or videos) to convey the capabilities, look and feel, and experience of your item to users. You must provide at least one—and preferably the maximum allowed five—screenshots of your item to be displayed in the store. Screenshots should demonstrate the actual user experience, focusing on the core features and content so users can anticipate what the extension’s experience will be like. Screenshots should reflect the most up-to-date functionality corresponding to the latest version of the extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include screenshots that are blurry, distorted, or pixelated in a way that is not an intentional aspect of your brand or user experience</li>
<li>Rotate screenshots appropriately. Do not upload images upside down, sideways, or otherwise skewed</li>
<li>Branding on screenshots/videos should be consistent with other branding elements on the store listing page (icon, promotional images, etc), so users can immediately associate them with your extension and brand</li>
<li>Include visual aids like infographics, images and videos to explain the onboarding flow, user experience, and/or main functionalities of the item</li>
<li>Images should not use too much text to avoid overwhelming the user</li>
<li>Use square corners, no padding (full bleed)</li>
<li>1280x800 or 640x400 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>{% Aside %} Screenshots at full 1280x800 resolution may look better on high-resolution displays. You can use 640x400 screenshots instead—for example if 1280x800 is too big to show your extension properly. {% endAside %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘better’ %} Make sure your screenshots are clear and sized correctly. Use visual aids in the screenshots to help explain how it works. {% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/w5wKTaZ5uDJe6EGQblak.png”, alt=“A fictional screenshot that is clear”, width=“800”, height=“467” %} {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘worse’ %} Use screenshots that are distorted, are of low quality, or have overwhelming amounts of text. {% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/j9iGWTYXD7xxbsCYvmfh.png”, alt=“A fictional screenshot that is blurry”, width=“800”, height=“467” %} {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %} Tip: If your extension supports multiple locales, you can provide locale-specific screenshots as described in <a href="/docs/webstore/i18n/">Internationalizing your app</a>. {% endAside %}</p>
<h3 id="promotional-images-promo-tiles-and-marquee-image">Promotional images: promo tiles and marquee image</h3>
<p>Promotional images are your chance to capture users’ attention and entice them to learn more. Don’t just use a screenshot; your images should communicate the brand and appear professional. Here are specifics about each promotional image:</p>
<p><strong>Small promo tile: 440x280 pixels</strong>   Appears on the homepage, category pages, and in search results.</p>
<p><strong>Large promo tile: 920x680 pixels</strong>   Not currently used. You do not need to provide a large promo tile at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Marquee image: 1400x560 pixels</strong>   This image is used if your item is chosen for the marquee feature (the rotating carousel on the top of the Chrome Web Store homepage). To increase your chances of being featured, ensure your marquee image is uncluttered, high-resolution, and has consistent branding elements to your other assets so users can immediately associate it with your extension and brand.</p>
<p>Here are some rules of thumb for designing your promotional images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid too much text</li>
<li>Avoid an image that is too “busy”</li>
<li>Make sure your image works even when shrunk to half size</li>
<li>Use saturated colors if possible; they tend to work well</li>
<li>Avoid using a lot of white and light gray</li>
<li>Fill the entire region</li>
<li>Make sure the edges are well defined</li>
<li>Avoid claims that misrepresents the extension’s or developer’s current status or performance on the Chrome Web Store (e.g. “Editor’s Choice” or “Number One”)</li>
<li>Branding on promotional images should be consistent with other branding elements on the store listing page (icon, screenshots, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>{% Compare ‘better’ %} Keep the image simple and clean, using colors and branding that matches your other assets. {% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/kc5spLGOAa06QvOn6VdI.png”, alt=“A fictional promo tile image that works”, width=“800”, height=“467” %} {% endCompare %}</p>
<p>{% if false %} {% Compare ‘worse’ %} Include too much text so that it’s hard to read or makes the image look overly “busy”. {% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/rvcp453BSjDvdO3WlmIo.png”, alt=“A fictional promo tile image that has problems”, width=“800”, height=“467” %} {% endCompare %} {% endif %}</p>
<p>{% Compare ‘worse’ %} Include claims that misrepresent your extension’s status. {% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/NcoamGn5czoqDzW7SQuG.png”, alt=“A fictional listing image that includes a misleading badge”, width=“800”, height=“467” %} {% endCompare %}</p>
<h2 id="additional-fields">Additional fields</h2>
<p>Including a website for your item and URLs for support pages can help build trust with users. Ensure these fields are filled out in the developer dashboard so users know where they can find more information about your item.</p>
