Add the store listing information for your item that isn’t in the ZIP file, such as a long description, screenshots, videos and links to related sites.

Product details
---------------

You’ll need to fill out the following details about your item:

-   A **detailed description** of your item. Write your description to entice users to download your item. Make sure to start your description with a concise statement of what your item does, so users can understand the main idea and features at a glance. Your description can then go on to provide more detail, promotional copy, update logs, and so forth.

{% Aside ‘caution’ %} Be detailed but make sure your description complies with the [Keyword Spam](/docs/webstore/spam-faq/#keyword-spam) policy. {% endAside %}

-   The **primary [category](/docs/webstore/best_practices/#choose-your-apps-category-well)** where your item should be listed.
-   Your item’s **language** to help users find it.

Graphic assets {: \#graphic-assets }
------------------------------------

At a minimum, you should provide the following promotional images:

-   A 128x128 **store icon**.
-   At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 **screenshot** or YouTube **video** to show off what your item does. These are displayed in your item’s Chrome Web Store listing in the following order:
    1.  Any localized video that you provide.
    2.  Any localized screenshots that you provide.
    3.  Any global (non-localized) video.
    4.  Global screenshots.
-   A 440x280 **small tile icon** that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.

### Learning more about images and branding

See [Supplying Images](/docs/webstore/images) for help on designing the images for your item, and [Branding Guidelines](/docs/webstore/branding) for information on how you can use Google brands.

{% Aside %} The quality of the images you supply can affect your item’s prominence on the Chrome Web Store. Be sure and read [Creating a great listing page](/docs/webstore/best_listing) for more details. {% endAside %}

Additional fields {: \#additional-fields }
------------------------------------------

You can include any of these optional links related to your item.

### Displaying your verified publisher status

The Chrome Web Store highlights verified publishers by placing a linked, official URL in the “Offered by:” line of the store listing. This official URL appears under the listing title and is linked to the website, as shown in the following example:

{% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/Vkm8Uhstw2NFVSSt87Vl.png”, alt=“Offered by: cecerduino.com example”, width=“351”, height=“143” %}

{% Aside %} If you are not a verified publisher, you can’t display this official URL: instead, the “Offered by:” displays your publisher name instead. {% endAside %}

To display your verified status, choose an official URL for your item from the **Official URL** pull-down as shown below:

{% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/m6b3XFmEakmH1ZqVhTwf.png”, alt=“Screenshot of official URL pulldown”, width=“800”, height=“184” %}

The pull-down for this field contains only those sites that have been verified as belonging to you. To add a verified site that you own, click on **Add a new site**. This opens the Google Search Console, where you can add and verify a site. See [Verify your site ownership](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080) for more details.

### Adding a homepage URL {: \#home-url }

To explain how your extension works in more detail, you can provide a direct link to your extension’s website in the **Homepage URL**. This link appears under the Additional information of your item.

{% Img src=“image/BhuKGJaIeLNPW9ehns59NfwqKxF2/j71L391YIhEAIZTVUuBw.png”, alt=“Homepage URL in Chrome Web Store item page”, width=“306”, height=“106” %}

### Providing a support URL {: \#support-url }

The Chrome Web Store provides a [built in user support](/docs/webstore/manage/#user-support-tab) experience under your items’ **Support tab**, but you can use a [dedicated support site](/docs/webstore/manage/#dedicated-support-site) by including a link in the **Support URL**.
