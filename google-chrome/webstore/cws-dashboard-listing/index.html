<p>You can include any of these optional links related to your item.</p>
<h3 id="displaying-your-verified-publisher-status">Displaying your verified publisher status</h3>
<p>The Chrome Web Store highlights verified publishers by placing a linked, official URL in the “Offered by:” line of the store listing. This official URL appears under the listing title and is linked to the website, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/Vkm8Uhstw2NFVSSt87Vl.png”, alt=“Offered by: cecerduino.com example”, width=“351”, height=“143” %}</p>
<p>{% Aside %} If you are not a verified publisher, you can’t display this official URL: instead, the “Offered by:” displays your publisher name instead. {% endAside %}</p>
<p>To display your verified status, choose an official URL for your item from the <strong>Official URL</strong> pull-down as shown below:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/SHhb2PDKzXTggPGAYpv8JgR81pX2/m6b3XFmEakmH1ZqVhTwf.png”, alt=“Screenshot of official URL pulldown”, width=“800”, height=“184” %}</p>
<p>The pull-down for this field contains only those sites that have been verified as belonging to you. To add a verified site that you own, click on <strong>Add a new site</strong>. This opens the Google Search Console, where you can add and verify a site. See <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080">Verify your site ownership</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="providing-a-support-url-support-url">Providing a support URL {: #support-url }</h3>
