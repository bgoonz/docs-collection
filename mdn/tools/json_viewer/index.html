  <p>The JSON viewer is new in Firefox 44.</p>

  <p>
    Before Firefox 53, the JSON viewer is enabled by default only in Firefox
    Developer Edition and Firefox Nightly. To enable this feature in other
    release channels, set the <code>devtools.jsonview.enabled</code> preference
    to <code>true</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Firefox 53 onwards, the JSON viewer is also enabled by default in Beta
    and the normal release version of Firefox.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Firefox includes a JSON viewer. If you open a JSON file in the browser, or
  view a remote URL with the Content-Type set to application/json, it is parsed
  and given syntax highlighting. Arrays and objects are shown collapsed, and you
  can expand them using the "+" icons.
</p>

<p>
  The JSON viewer provides a search box that you can use to filter the JSON.
</p>

<p>You can also view the raw JSON and pretty-print it.</p>

<p>
  Finally, if the document was the result of a network request, the viewer
  displays the request and response headers.
