An SLD ([Second Level Domain](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Second-level_Domain)) is the part of the domain name that is located right before a *Top Level Domain* ({{Glossary("TLD")}}). For example, in `mozilla.org` the SLD is `mozilla` and the TLD is `org`.

See [Second Level Domain](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Second-level_Domain) for more information.
