<span class="seoSummary">A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.</span>

An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.
