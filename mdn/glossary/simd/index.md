SIMD (pronounced "sim-dee") is short for **Single Instruction/Multiple Data** which is one {{Interwiki("wikipedia","Flynn%27s\_taxonomy","classification of computer architectures")}}. SIMD allows one same operation to be performed on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus performance gains â€” for example, for 3D graphics and video processing, physics simulations or cryptography, and other domains.

See also {{Glossary("SISD")}} for a sequential architecture with no parallelism in either the instructions or the data sets.
