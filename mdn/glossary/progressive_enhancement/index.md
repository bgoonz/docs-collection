**Progressive enhancement** is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

[Feature detection](/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection) is generally used to determine whether browsers can handle more modern functionality, while [polyfills](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) are often used to add missing features with JavaScript.
