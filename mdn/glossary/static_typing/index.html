<p>
  A <strong>statically-typedÂ </strong>language is a language (such as Java, C,
  or C++) where variable types are known at compile time. In most of these
  languages, types must be expressly indicated by the programmer; in other cases
  (such as OCaml), type inference allows the programmer to not indicate their
  variable types.
