**Effective connection type** (ECT) refers to the measured network performance, returning a cellular connection type, like 3G, even if the actual connection is tethered broadband or WiFi, based on the time between the browser requesting a page and effective type of the connection.

The values of '`slow-2g`', '`2g`', '`3g`', and '`4g`' are determined using observed round-trip times and downlink values.

[effectiveType](/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType) is a property of the [Network Information API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API), exposed to JavaScript via the [navigator.connection](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection) object. To see your effective connection type, open the console of the developer tools of a supporting browser and enter the following:

    navigator.connection.effectiveType;
