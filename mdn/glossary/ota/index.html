<p>
  <em>Over The Air</em> (<strong>OTA</strong>) refers to automatic updating of
  software on connected devices from a central server. All device owners
  receiving a given set of updates are on the same "channel", and each device
  often can access several channels (e.g. for production or engineering builds).
