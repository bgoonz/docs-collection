JavaScript's **strict mode** is a way to *opt in* to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "{{Glossary("Sloppy\_mode", "sloppy mode")}}". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it *intentionally* has different semantics from normal code.

Strict mode for an entire script is invoked by including the statement `"use strict";` before any other statements.
