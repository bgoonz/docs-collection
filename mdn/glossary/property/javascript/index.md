A **JavaScript property** is a characteristic of an object, often describing attributes associated with a data structure.

There are two kinds of properties: 

-   *Instance properties* hold data that are specific to a given object instance. 
-   *Static properties* hold data that are shared among all object instances.

A property has a name (a {{glossary("string")}}) and a value ({{glossary("primitive")}}, {{glossary("method")}}, or {{glossary("object reference")}}). Note that when we say that "a property holds an object", that is shorthand for "a property holds an object *reference*".  This distinction matters because the original referenced object remains unchanged when you change the property's value.
