A **grid row** is a horizontal track in a [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), that is the space between two horizontal grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, rows may be created in the *implicit grid* when items are placed outside of rows created in the *explicit grid*. These rows will be auto sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the axis along which rows run is known as the *inline, or row, axis*.
