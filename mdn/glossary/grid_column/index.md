A **grid column** is a vertical track in a [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), and is the space between two vertical grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, columns may be created in the *implicit grid* when items are placed outside of columns created in the *explicit grid*. These columns will be auto-sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the axis down which columns run is known as the *block, or column, axis*.
