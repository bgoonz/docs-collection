<span class="seoSummary">A **database** is a storing system that collects organized data, to make some works easier like searching, structure, and extend.</span>

In web development, most databases use the relational database management system (RDBMS) to organize data and programming in {{glossary("SQL")}}. Some databases, however, don't follow the former mechanism to organized data, which called NoSQL.

Some famous server-side RDBMS are *MySQL*(or *MariaDB* which is a fork of it), *SQL Server*, and *Oracle Database*. On the other hand, someÂ famous NoSQL examples are *MongoDB*, *Cassandra*, and *Redis*.

Browsers also have their own database system called {{glossary("IndexedDB")}}.
