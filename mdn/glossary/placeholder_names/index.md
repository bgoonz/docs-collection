<span class="seoSummary">Placeholder names are commonly used in cryptography to indicate the participants in a conversation, without resorting to terminology such as "Party A," "eavesdropper," and "malicious attacker."</span> The most commonly used names are:

-   *Alice* and *Bob*, two parties who want to send messages to each other, occasionally joined by *Carol*, a third participant
-   *Eve*, a passive attacker who is eavesdropping on Alice and Bob's conversation
-   *Mallory*, an active attacker ("man-in-the-middle") who is able to modify their conversation and replay old messages
