    <p>
      As you learned in the
      <a href="/api/get-started/extension-anatomy">Extension Anatomy</a> topic, an extension
      exposes the <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> methods and Visual
      Studio Code will manage its lifecycle. This topic provides more details on the
      <strong>Extension Host</strong> that manages all running extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Extension host</strong> is a Node.js process in VS Code responsible for
      loading and running extensions. Although you donâ€™t need to worry about the Extension
      Host when you are writing extensions, it is still useful to know what the Extension
      Host does to your extension.
    </p>
    <h2 id="stability-and-performance">Stability and Performance</h2>
    <p>
      VS Code aims to deliver a stable and performant editor to users, and misbehaving
      extensions should not impact the user experience. The Extension Host in VS Code
      prevents extensions from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Impacting startup performance</li>
      <li>Slowing down UI operations</li>
      <li>Modifying the UI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, VS Code lets extensions declare their
      <a href="/api/references/activation-events">Activation Events</a> and loads them
      lazily. For example, the Markdown extension should only be loaded when a user opens a
      Markdown file. This makes sure that extensions do not consume unnecessary CPU and
      memory.
