# Extension Host

As you learned in the [Extension Anatomy](/api/get-started/extension-anatomy) topic, an extension exposes the `activate` and `deactivate` methods and Visual Studio Code will manage its lifecycle. This topic provides more details on the **Extension Host** that manages all running extensions.

**Extension host** is a Node.js process in VS Code responsible for loading and running extensions. Although you donâ€™t need to worry about the Extension Host when you are writing extensions, it is still useful to know what the Extension Host does to your extension.

## Stability and Performance

VS Code aims to deliver a stable and performant editor to users, and misbehaving extensions should not impact the user experience. The Extension Host in VS Code prevents extensions from:

- Impacting startup performance
- Slowing down UI operations
- Modifying the UI

Additionally, VS Code lets extensions declare their [Activation Events](/api/references/activation-events) and loads them lazily. For example, the Markdown extension should only be loaded when a user opens a Markdown file. This makes sure that extensions do not consume unnecessary CPU and memory.
