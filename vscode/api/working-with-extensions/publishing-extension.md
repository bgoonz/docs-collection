# Publishing Extensions

Once you have made a high-quality extension, you can publish it to the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) so others can find, download, and use your extension. Alternatively, you can [package](#packaging-extensions) an extension into the installable VSIX format and share it with other users.

This topics covers:

- Using [vsce](#vsce), the CLI tool for managing VS Code extensions
- [Packaging](#packaging-extensions), [publishing](#publishing-extensions) and [unpublishing](#unpublishing-extensions) extensions
- [Registering a `publisherId`](#create-a-publisher) necessary for publishing extensions

## vsce

[vsce](https://github.com/microsoft/vsce), short for “Visual Studio Code Extensions”, is a command-line tool for packaging, publishing and managing VS Code extensions.

### Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

    npm install -g vsce

### Usage

You can use `vsce` to easily [package](#packaging-extensions) and [publish](#publishing-extensions) your extensions:

    $ cd myExtension
    $ vsce package
    # myExtension.vsix generated
    $ vsce publish
    # <publisherID>.myExtension published to VS Code Marketplace

`vsce` can also search, retrieve metadata, and unpublish extensions. For a reference on all the available `vsce` commands, run `vsce --help`.

## Publishing extensions

---

**Note:** Due to security concerns, `vsce` will not publish extensions that contain user-provided SVG images.

The publishing tool checks the following constraints:

- The icon provided in `package.json` may not be an SVG.
- The badges provided in the `package.json` may not be SVGs unless they are from [trusted badge providers](/api/references/extension-manifest#approved-badges).
- Image URLs in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` need to resolve to `https` URLs.
- Images in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` may not be SVGs unless they are from [trusted badge providers](/api/references/extension-manifest#approved-badges).

---

Visual Studio Code uses [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) for its Marketplace services. This means that authentication, hosting, and management of extensions are provided through Azure DevOps.

`vsce` can only publish extensions using [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/pats). You need to create at least one in order to publish an extension.

### Get a Personal Access Token

First off, follow the documentation to [create your own organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization) in Azure DevOps. In the following examples, the organization’s name is `vscode`, you should use your new organization name as appropriate. Note that the organization’s name doesn’t necessarily have to be same as your publisher name.

From your organization’s home page (for example: `https://dev.azure.com/vscode`), open the User settings dropdown menu next to your profile image and select **Personal access tokens**:

![Personal settings menu](images/publishing-extension/token1.png)

On the **Personal Access Tokens** page, select **New Token** to create a new Personal Access Token and set the following details:

- Give it a Name
- Set Organization to **All accessible organizations**
- Optionally extend its expiration date
- Set Scopes to **Custom defined** and choose the **Marketplace &gt; Manage** scope

![Create personal access token](images/publishing-extension/token2.png)

Select **Create** and you’ll be presented with your newly created Personal Access Token. **Copy** it, you’ll need it to create a publisher.

### Create a publisher

A **publisher** is an identity who can publish extensions to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Every extension needs to include a `publisher` name in its [`package.json` file](/api/references/extension-manifest).

You can create a new publisher through the Visual Studio Marketplace publisher [management page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage). You need to login in with the same Microsoft account you used to create the [Personal Access Token](/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token) in the previous section.

Test your publisher’s personal access token using [`vsce`](#vsce), while at the same time storing it for later usage:

    vsce login <publisher name>

### Publish an extension

You can publish an extension using [`vsce`](#vsce) with the `publish` command:

    vsce publish

This command will ask for the personal access token, if you haven’t already provided it with the `vsce login` command above.

Alternatively, you can [package the extension](#packaging-extensions) (`vsce package`) and manually upload it to the [Visual Studio Marketplace publisher management page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).

![Add an extension through management page](images/publishing-extension/add-extension.png)

## Review extension installs and ratings

The same [Visual Studio Marketplace publisher management page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage) gives you access to each extension’s Acquisition Trend over time, as well as Total Acquisition counts and Ratings & Reviews. Right-click an extension and choose **Reports**.

![Marketplace extension report](images/publishing-extension/extension-report.png)

## Auto-incrementing the extension version

You can auto-increment an extension’s version number when you publish by specifying the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible number to increment: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.

For example, if you want to update an extension’s version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, you would specify `minor`:

    vsce publish minor

This will modify the extension’s `package.json` [version](/api/references/extension-manifest#fields) attribute before publishing the extension.

You can also specify a complete SemVer compatible version on the command line:

    vsce publish 2.0.1

> **Note:** If `vsce publish` is run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag via [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version#description). The default commit message will be extension’s version, but you can supply a custom commit message using the `-m` flag. (The current version can be referenced from the commit message with `%s`.)

## Unpublishing extensions

You can unpublish an extension with the vsce tool by specifying the extension ID `publisher.extension`.

    vsce unpublish (publisher name).(extension name)

> **Note:** When you unpublish an extension, the Marketplace will remove any extension statistics it has collected. You may want to update your extension rather than unpublish it.

## Packaging extensions

If you want to test an extension on your local install of VS Code or distribute an extension without publishing it to VS Code Marketplace, you can choose to package your extension. `vsce` can package your extension into a `VSIX` file, from which users can easily install. Some extensions publish VSIX files to each GitHub release.

For extension authors, they can run `vsce package` in extension root folder to create such VSIX files.

For users who receive such a VSIX file, they can install the extension with `code --install-extension my-extension-0.0.1.vsix`.

### Sharing privately with others

If you want to share your extension with others privately, you can send them your packaged extension `.vsix` file.

## Your extension folder

To load an extension, you need to copy the files to your VS Code extensions folder `.vscode/extensions`. Depending on your platform, it is located in the following folders:

- **Windows** `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
- **macOS** `~/.vscode/extensions`
- **Linux** `~/.vscode/extensions`

## Visual Studio Code compatibility

When authoring an extension, you will need to describe what is the extension’s compatibility to Visual Studio Code itself. This can be done via the `engines.vscode` field inside `package.json`:

    {
      "engines": {
        "vscode": "^1.8.0"
      }
    }

A value of `1.8.0` means that your extension is compatible only with VS Code `1.8.0`. A value of `^1.8.0` means that your extension is compatible with VS Code `1.8.0` and onwards, including `1.8.1`, `1.9.0`, etc.

You can use the `engines.vscode` field to make sure the extension only gets installed for clients that contain the API you depend on. This mechanism plays well with the Stable release as well as the Insiders one.

For example, imagine that the latest Stable version of VS Code is `1.8.0` and that during `1.9.0`’s development a new API is introduced and thus made available in the Insider release through version `1.9.0-insider`. If you want to publish an extension version that benefits from this API, you should indicate a version dependency of `^1.9.0`. Your new extension version will be installed only on VS Code `>=1.9.0`, which means all current Insider customers will get it, while the Stable ones will only get the update when Stable reaches `1.9.0`.

## Advanced usage

### Marketplace integration

You can customize how your extension looks in the Visual Studio Marketplace. See the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/golang.go) for an example.

Here are some tips for making your extension look great on the Marketplace:

- A `README.md` file at the root of your extension will be used to populate the extension’s Marketplace page’s contents. `vsce` will modify README links for you in two different ways:
  - If you add a `repository` field to your `package.json` and it is a public GitHub repository, `vsce` will automatically detect it and adjust relative links accordingly, using the `master` branch by default. You can override the GitHub branch with the `--githubBranch` flag when running `vsce package` or `vsce publish`.
  - For more fine-grained control, you can set the `--baseContentUrl` and `--baseImagesUrl` flags to set the base URLs for relative links.
- A `LICENSE` file at the root of your extension will be used as the contents for the extension’s license.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of your extension will be used as the contents for the extension’s change log.
- You can set the banner background color by setting `galleryBanner.color` to the intended hex value in `package.json`.
- You can set an icon by setting `icon` to a relative path to a squared `128px` PNG file included in your extension, in `package.json`.

Also see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](/api/references/extension-manifest#marketplace-presentation-tips).

### `.vscodeignore`

You can create a `.vscodeignore` file to exclude some files from being included in your extension’s package. This file is a collection of [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) patterns, one per line.

For example:

    **/*.ts
    **/tsconfig.json
    !file.ts

You should ignore all files not needed at runtime. For example, if your extension is written in TypeScript, you should ignore all `**/*.ts` files, like in the previous example.

**Note:** Development dependencies listed in `devDependencies` will be automatically ignored, you don’t need to add them to the `.vscodeignore` file.

### Pre-publish step

It’s possible to add a pre-publish step to your manifest file. The command will be called every time the extension is packaged.

    {
      "name": "uuid",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "publisher": "someone",
      "engines": {
        "vscode": "0.10.x"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "vscode:prepublish": "tsc"
      }
    }

This will always invoke the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler whenever the extension is packaged.

## Common questions

### I get 403 Forbidden (or 401 Unauthorized) error when I try to publish my extension?

One easy mistake to make when creating the PAT (Personal Access Token) is to not select **All accessible organizations** in the **Organizations** field dropdown (instead selecting a specific organization). You should also set the Authorized Scopes to `Marketplace (Manage)` for the publish to work.

### I can’t unpublish my extension through the `vsce` tool?

You may have changed your extension ID or publisher name. You can also manage your extensions directly on the Marketplace by going to the [manage page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage). You can update or unpublish your extension from your publisher manage page.

### Why does vsce not preserve file attributes?

Note that when building and publishing your extension from Windows, all the files included in the extension package will lack POSIX file attributes, namely the executable bit. Some `node_modules` dependencies rely on those attributes to properly function. Publishing from Linux and macOS works as expected.

### Can I publish from a continuous integration (CI) build?

Yes, see the [Automated publishing](/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration#automated-publishing) section of the [Continuous Integration](/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration) topic to learn how to configure Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Travis CI to automatically publish your extension to the Marketplace.
