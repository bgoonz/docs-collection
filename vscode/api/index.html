    <p>
      Visual Studio Code is built with extensibility in mind. From the UI to the editing
      experience, almost every part of VS Code can be customized and enhanced through the
      Extension API. In fact, many core features of VS Code are built as
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions">extensions</a> and
      use the same Extension API.
