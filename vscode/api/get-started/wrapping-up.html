    <p>
      In the <a href="/api/get-started/your-first-extension">Your First Extension</a> topic,
      you learned how to create, run, and debug an extension. In the
      <a href="/api/get-started/extension-anatomy">Extension Anatomy</a> topic, you learned
      fundamental concepts to Visual Studio Code extension development. However, we have
      only seen the tip of the iceberg, and here are some suggested routes for furthering
      your VS Code extension development skills.
    </p>
    <h2 id="extension-capabilities">Extension Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
      In this section, we split the <a href="/api/references/vscode-api">VS Code API</a> and
      <a href="/api/references/contribution-points">Contribution Points</a> into a few
      categories, each with short descriptions as to what your extension could achieve.
      Validate that your extension idea is achievable by reviewing the
      <a href="/api/references/vscode-api">VS Code API</a> or reading the
      <a href="/api/extension-capabilities/overview">Extension Capabilities</a> section for
      new extension ideas.
    </p>
    <h2 id="guides-samples">Guides &amp; Samples</h2>
    <p>
      We have a great collection of sample extensions that you can adapt from, and some of
      them include a detailed guide that explains the source code. You can find all Samples
      &amp; Guides in the
      <a href="/api/extension-guides/overview">Extension Guide Listing</a> or the
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples"
        >vscode-extension-samples</a
      >
      repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="extension-guidelines">Extension Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      To help make your extension fit seemlessly into the VS Code user interface, refer to
      the <a href="/api/references/extension-guidelines">Extension Guidelines</a>, where
      youâ€™ll learn the best practices for creating extension UI and conventions for
      following the preferred VS Code workflows.
    </p>
    <h2 id="testing-and-publishing">Testing and Publishing</h2>
