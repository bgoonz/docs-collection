    <h1 id="workspace-trust-extension-guide">Workspace Trust Extension Guide</h1>
    <h2 id="what-is-workspace-trust">What is Workspace Trust?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="/docs/editor/workspace-trust">Workspace Trust</a> is a feature driven by the
      security risks associated with unintended code execution when a user opens a workspace
      in VS Code. For example, consider that a language extension, in order to provide
      functionality, may execute code from the currently loaded workspace. In this scenario,
      the user should trust that the contents of the workspace are not malicious. Workspace
      Trust centralizes this decision within VS Code and supports a
      <a href="/docs/editor/workspace-trust#_restricted-mode">Restricted Mode</a> to protect
      against automatic code execution so that extension authors do not have to handle this
      infrastructure themselves. VS Code offers static declaration and API support to
      onboard extensions quickly without the need to duplicate code across extensions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>
    <h3 id="static-declarations">Static declarations</h3>
    <p>
      In your extensionâ€™s <code>package.json</code>, VS Code supports the following new
      <code>capabilities</code> property <code>untrustedWorkspaces</code>:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode typescript"
      ><code class="sourceCode typescript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">capabilities<span class="op">:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  untrustedWorkspaces<span class="op">:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">    <span class="op">{</span> supported<span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">true</span> <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">|</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">    <span class="op">{</span> supported<span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">false</span><span class="op">,</span> description<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">string</span> <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">|</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5">    <span class="op">{</span> supported<span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&#39;limited&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> description<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">string</span><span class="op">,</span> restrictedConfigurations<span class="op">?:</span> <span class="dt">string</span><span class="op">[]</span> <span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>For the <code>supported</code> property, the following values are accepted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>true</code> - The extension is fully supported in Restricted Mode as it does
        not need Workspace Trust to perform any functionality. It will be enabled exactly as
        before.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>false</code> - The extension is not supported in Restricted Mode as it cannot
        function without Workspace Trust. It will remain disabled until Workspace Trust is
        granted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>'limited'</code> - Some features of the extension are supported in Restricted
        Mode. Trust-sensitive features should be disabled until Workspace Trust is granted.
        The extension can use the VS Code API to hide or disable these features. Workspace
        settings can be gated by trust automatically using the
        <code>restrictedConfigurations</code> property.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the <code>description</code> property, a description of why trust is needed must
      be provided to help the user understand what features will be disabled or what they
      should review before granting or denying Workspace Trust. If <code>supported</code> is
      set to <code>true</code>, this property is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value for the <code>description</code> property should be added to
      <code>package.nls.json</code> and then referenced in the
      <code>package.json</code> file for localization support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>restrictedConfigurations</code> property takes an array of configuration
      setting IDs. For the settings listed, the extension will not be given
      workspace-defined values when in Restricted Mode for an untrusted workspace.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-to-support-restricted-mode">How to support Restricted Mode?</h2>
    <p>
      To help extension authors understand what is in scope for Workspace Trust and what
      types of features are safe in Restricted Mode, here are a list of questions to
      consider.
    </p>
    <h3 id="does-my-extension-have-a-main-entry-point">
      Does my extension have a main entry point?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If an extension does not have a <code>main</code> entry point (for example themes and
      language grammars), the extension does not require Workspace Trust. Extension authors
      do not need to take any action for such extensions as they will continue to function
      independent whether the workspace is trusted or not.
    </p>
    <h3 id="does-my-extension-rely-on-files-in-the-opened-workspace-to-provide-features">
      Does my extension rely on files in the opened workspace to provide features?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This can mean things like settings that can be set by the workspace or actual code in
      the workspace. If the extension never uses any of the contents of the workspace, it
      probably doesnâ€™t require trust. Otherwise, take a look at the other questions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="does-my-extension-treat-any-contents-of-the-workspace-as-code">
      Does my extension treat any contents of the workspace as code?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most common example of this is using a projectâ€™s workspace dependencies, such as
      the Node.js modules stored in the local workspace. A malicious workspace might check
      in a compromised version of the module. Thus, this is a security risk for the user and
      extension. In addition, an extension may rely on JavaScript or other configuration
      files that control the extension or other modulesâ€™ behavior. There are many other
      examples, such as executing an opened code file to determine its output for error
      reporting.
    </p>
    <h3
      id="does-my-extension-use-settings-that-determine-code-execution-that-can-be-defined-in-the-workspace"
    >
      Does my extension use settings that determine code execution that can be defined in
      the workspace?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Your extension might use settings values as flags to a CLI that your extension
      executes. If these settings are overridden by a malicious workspace, they could be
      used as an attack vector against your extension. On the other hand, if the settingsâ€™
      values are only used to detect certain conditions, then it may not be a security risk
      and does not require Workspace Trust. For example, an extension might check whether
      the value of a preferred shell setting is <code>bash</code> or <code>pwsh</code> to
      determine what documentation to show. The
      <a href="#configurations-settings">Configurations (settings)</a> section below has
      guidance on settings to help you find the optimal configuration for your extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not an exhaustive list of cases that might require Workspace Trust. As we
      review more extensions, we will update this list. Use this list to think of similar
      behavior your extension might be doing when considering Workspace Trust.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-if-i-dont-make-changes-to-my-extension">
      What if I donâ€™t make changes to my extension?
    </h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, an extension that does not contribute anything to their
      <code>package.json</code> will be treated as not supporting Workspace Trust. It will
      be disabled when a workspace is in Restricted Mode and the user will be notified that
      some extensions are not working due to Workspace Trust. This measure is the most
      security-conscious approach for the user. Even though this is the default, it is a
      best practice to set the appropriate value indicating that as an extension author, you
      have made the effort to protect the user and your extension from malicious workspace
      content.
    </p>
    <h2 id="workspace-trust-api">Workspace Trust API</h2>
    <p>
      As described above, the first step to using the API is adding the static declarations
      to your <code>package.json</code>. The easiest method of onboarding would be to use a
      <code>false</code> value for the <code>supported</code> property. Once again, this is
      the default behavior even if you do nothing, but itâ€™s a good signal to the user that
      you have made a deliberate choice. In this case, your extension does not need to do
      anything else. It will not be activated until trust is given and then your extension
      will know that it is executing with the consent of the user. However, if your
      extension only requires trust for part of its functionality, this is likely not the
      best option.
    </p>
    <p>
      For extensions that wish to gate their features on Workspace Trust, they should use
      the <code>'limited'</code> value for the <code>supported</code> property, and VS Code
      provides the following API:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode typescript"
      ><code class="sourceCode typescript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="im">export</span> <span class="im">namespace</span> <span class="dt">workspace</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">  <span class="co">/**</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="co">    * When true, the user has explicitly trusted the contents of the workspace.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" title="4"><span class="co">    */</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" title="5">  <span class="im">export</span> <span class="kw">const</span> isTrusted<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">boolean</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" title="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" title="7">  <span class="co">/**</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-8" title="8"><span class="co">    * Event that fires when the current workspace has been trusted.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-9" title="9"><span class="co">    */</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-10" title="10">  <span class="im">export</span> <span class="kw">const</span> onDidGrantWorkspaceTrust<span class="op">:</span> <span class="bu">Event</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="dt">void</span><span class="op">&gt;;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-11" title="11"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Use the <code>isTrusted</code> property to determine if the current workspace is
      trusted and the <code>onDidGrantWorkspaceTrust</code> event to listen for when trust
      has been granted to the workspace. You can use this API to block specific code paths
      and perform any necessary registrations once the workspace has been trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      VS Code also exposes a context key <code>isWorkspaceTrusted</code> for use in
      <code>when</code> clauses as described below.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contribution-points">Contribution points</h2>
    <h3 id="commands-views-or-other-ui">Commands, views, or other UI</h3>
    <p>
      When the user has not trusted the workspace, they will be operating in Restricted Mode
      with limited functionality geared towards browsing code. Any features that you disable
      in Restricted Mode should be hidden from the user. This can be done via
      <a href="/api/references/when-clause-contexts">when clause contexts</a> and the
      context key <code>isWorkspaceTrusted</code>. A command can still be called even if it
      is not presented in the UI, so you should block execution or not register a command
      based on the API above in your extension code.
    </p>
    <h3 id="configurations-settings">Configurations (settings)</h3>
    <p>
      First, you should review your settings to determine if they need to take trust into
      account. As described above, a workspace may define a value for a setting that your
      extension consumes that is malicious to the use. If you identify settings that are
      vulnerable, you should use <code>'limited'</code> for the
      <code>supported</code> property and list the setting ID in the
      <code>restrictedConfigurations</code> array.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you add a setting ID to the <code>restrictedConfigurations</code> array, VS Code
      will only return the user-defined value of the setting in Restricted Mode. Your
      extension then doesnâ€™t need to make any additional code changes to handle the setting.
      When trust is granted, a configuration change event will fire in addition to the
      Workspace Trust event.
    </p>
    <h3 id="debug-extensions">Debug extensions</h3>
    <p>
      VS Code will prevent debugging in Restricted Mode. For this reason, debugging
      extensions generally do not need to require trust and should select
      <code>true</code> for the <code>supported</code> property. However, if your extension
      provides additional functionality, commands, or settings that are not part of the
      built-in debugging flow, you should use <code>'limited'</code> and follow the above
      guidance.
    </p>
    <h3 id="task-providers">Task providers</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to debugging, VS Code prevents running tasks in Restricted Mode. If your
      extension provides additional functionality, commands, or settings that are not part
      of the built-in tasks flow, you should use <code>'limited'</code> and follow the above
      guidance. Otherwise, you can specify <code>supported: true</code>.
