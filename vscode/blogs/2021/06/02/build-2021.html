      <p>“That’s a wrap! Now catch up with content on-demand.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/">Build 2021</a>, Microsoft’s main
      event for developers, ended last week. The Visual Studio Code team,
      alongside all our colleagues from Developer Division, worked really hard
      to deliver a lot of exciting content over the span of this two-day virtual
      event!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though Build is over, all the sessions are now available to watch
      on-demand. You can rewatch a live session, catch up with content you may
      have missed, or just learn something new; all conveniently at your own
      pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the sessions that were presented, here is a hand-picked
      selection for you, VS Code users and developers, that we hope you’ll
      enjoy!
