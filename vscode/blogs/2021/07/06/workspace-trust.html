      Can I trust myself? This is the existential question facing many Visual
      Studio Code users since the
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_57">1.57 update</a>.

    <p>
      While we can’t answer that question for you, we can tell you more about
      why we’ve introduced the concept of Workspace Trust.
    </p>
    <p>But first, a little background.</p>
    <h2 id="cats-and-keyboards-and-bad-apples">
      Cats and keyboards, and bad apples
    </h2>
    <p>
      The internet is full of happy things, like videos of cats typing on
      keyboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      For developers, it’s also full of tools, packages, and open source built
      by good people, who want to help you solve that problem you’ve been
      working on for hours. Development tools like VS Code integrate package
      managers, code linters, task runners, bundlers, etc. to provide enjoyable
      experiences that harness the power of the latest and greatest advancements
      from the ever-evolving community.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the productivity afforded by this rich ecosystem is often a
      result of the broad access we provide to our development machines. Combine
      that with the rapid evolution and viral sharing and consumption, developer
      tools are an appealing target for exploitation, especially considering
      attackers can use our machines to further spread attacks (for example, via
      auth tokens stored on developer machines or even through the software
      authored by the developer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a developer is rewarding, but it’s also a risky business. To
      contribute to a project, you inherently need to trust its authors because
      activities such as running <code>npm install</code> or <code>make</code>,
      building a Java or C# project, automated testing, or debugging, all mean
      that code from the project is executing on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal with the
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust"
        >Workspace Trust</a
      >
      feature is to find the right balance, to be safe from the few “bad apples”
      who want to ruin it for everyone, while continuing to ensure we can have
      all the nice things that make development so much fun.
    </p>
    <h2 id="hey-its-just-an-editor-right">Hey, it’s just an editor, right?</h2>
    <figure>

    <p>
      Yes, VS Code is an editor. However, like most modern editors, it is
      capable of running code from the workspace on your behalf to provide a
      richer development experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running and debugging code is an obvious example. Code execution that may
      not be so obvious could be the <code>preLaunchTask</code> that runs before
      starting the app and can run a build that has an extra task executing
      arbitrary code unrelated to the build. What about the npm module that
      steals your crypto wallet private keys? Make a simple edit and a malicious
      linter is loaded from the <code>node_modules</code> folder, instead of the
      one that is installed globally. Even reading the code can be deceptive,
      attackers can use Unicode hacks to
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116939"
        >hide malicious code in plain sight</a
      >. Heck, you don’t even have to open any source code
      <a href="https://github.com/lucky/bad_actor_poc">to be owned</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intent here isn’t to scare you away from all the great tools out there
      (including VS Code) or to make you change careers. It is to raise
      awareness that there are many attack opportunities when you download code
      from the internet written by a person or an organization that you don’t
      have any type of trust relationship with.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whack-a-mole">Whack-a-Mole</h2>
    <p>
      In all the scenarios above, the tools are working as they were designed,
      and in non-nefarious code bases, they are extremely productive. Setting up
      a <code>preLaunchTask</code> to build the app before debugging is a great
      time saver as you don’t have to manually build it from the terminal after
      every change. Linters are highly customizable to support every team’s
      preferred coding guideline and style (<em>yes, tabs vs. spaces</em>).
      Pre-commit hooks let you check if you’ve forgotten something or to make
      sure tests run before committing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is unlikely you would be subject to all these attacks at the same
      time. In fact, there has not (yet) been an exploit through VS Code because
      there is a great community of experts who have made us aware when new
      opportunities arise. Our approach, before Workspace Trust, was to address
      each scenario at the point of vulnerability with a localized permission
      prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the Jupyter extension warned users that embedded JavaScript
      can run when you open the visualizers in a Notebook:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="jupyter-notebook-warning.png"
        alt="Jupyter Notebook security warning"
      />
      <figcaption>Jupyter Notebook security warning</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The ESLint vulnerability was a
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint/issues/1012">doozy</a>
      because it runs when the workspace loads (this was our first modal
      dialog).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="eslint-warning.png" alt="ESLint extension security warning" />
      <figcaption>ESLint extension security warning</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This, it turns out, is a losing battle. Users are interrupted with
      multiple (and slightly different) permission prompts that don’t apply to
      the entire workspace.
      <em>I trust you, you, you, you, not you, and you, but only on Tuesdays</em
      >. For us, it’s a constant game of
      <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/whack-a-mole"
        >Whack-a-Mole</a
      >, plugging each vulnerability as it is exposed with yet another prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, one of the patterns we follow when building VS Code is to look at what
      experiences are being implemented similarly but inconsistently across the
      tool and extensions, and see if we can bring it into the core. Trust
      prompting followed this pattern, so we decided to look at building an
      experience and API that both the tool and extensions could take advantage
      of, with a (hopefully) clearer user experience.
    </p>
    <h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you understand some of the various ways code can be run without
      you knowing, hopefully you have a better idea why we are asking this
      question up front.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="do-you-trust-question.png"
        alt="Do you trust the authors notification"
      />
      <figcaption>Do you trust the authors notification</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We specifically ask if you trust the authors of this workspace because VS
      Code can’t tell if the code is malicious or not (<em
        >hey, we just know 1’s and 0’s</em
      >), where it came from, if you intend to contribute to the project, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, on the other hand, are smart and you know where the code came from:
      you (<em>ok</em>), your company (<em>probably ok</em>), your buddy Kai
      (<em>depends</em>), or some random person on the internet (<em
        >definitely not</em
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      That knowledge helps make the tool smarter. If you trust the author,
      great! The tools and extensions have the green light to do their thing and
      provide a magical experience, and we’re not going to bug you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t, you are telling us
      <strong>be careful VS Code, don’t execute any code</strong>. This is what
      we call <strong>Restricted Mode</strong>, where potentially harmful
      functionality is disabled so you can more safely browse the code and
      eventually make an informed decision.
    </p>
    <h2 id="but-that-dialog">But that dialog!</h2>
    <p>
      We hear you, the modal dialog is pretty big and it keeps coming up for
      every new folder you open, unless you take action to configure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn’t start with this design. We looked at the
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint/issues/1012"
        >ESLint modal dialog saga</a
      >
      and asked ourselves if we could provide a non-blocking experience using
      visual clues and a single notification prompt that was delayed for as long
      as possible. We wanted to be unobtrusive, start in Restricted Mode
      (without you really noticing) and prompt for trust at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We introduced a “passive” trust notification where you could tell us if
      you trusted the workspace. We cycled through various UI treatments to
      signal that the workspace was not trusted, including augmenting the
      Settings gear icon and introducing a new security icon.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="trust-security-icons.png"
        alt="Several early versions of a security icons and badges"
      />

      <p>
        If you use the
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders">Insiders</a> builds,
        you will get the latest iterations on new experiences in VS Code like
        we’re talking about with Workspace Trust. Insiders ships daily and we
        use it to build VS Code.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The idea being a user (you!) could decide, <strong>on your terms</strong>,
      when to grant or deny trust of the workspace. When the tool or an
      extension really needed access, only then would we then put up a
      notification asking if you trusted the workspace:
    </p>
    <figure>

        alt="Workspace Trust required prompt"
      />
      <figcaption>Workspace Trust required prompt</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now, I’m sure many of you will agree, VS Code suffers from a bit of what
      we call “Notification Fatigue” (<em>I promise we are working on it</em>
      😊). In our testing, we saw that people simply ignored the notification.
      Users did not see the notification on the gear or even the new security
      icons. Usage data showed a very low rate of granting trust through the
      passive notification. In user studies, we watched people spend all their
      time thinking they had broken something, and then spend time
      troubleshooting, trying to get back to their expected state.
    </p>
    <p>
      We intended to be unobtrusive and delay as long as possible, but the
      reality was that, while in Restricted Mode, the product felt broken, and
      people thought it was their fault. Not a great place to be for either of
      us.

    <h2 id="putting-you-in-control">Putting you in control</h2>
    <p>
      The decision to trust a folder has a fundamental impact on the
      capabilities of VS Code, so after all the research we decided the right
      thing was to ask the trust question right away when you try to open a
      folder. Because the modal dialog is disruptive, we try to balance things
      out by making the dialog powerful so that you could answer a couple of
      questions and in the end, see the prompt much less often in your
      day-to-day work.
    </p>
    <p>
      From our own dogfooding as well as through interviews with other
      developers, we found that people generally have a primary folder where
      they put all their sources and consider it trustworthy. We therefore added
      the ability to trust the <strong>parent</strong> folder directly from the
      dialog. You can trust it and all the sub folders with one click and then
      you won’t see the trust prompt again.
    </p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>Trust parent folder checkbox</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="workspace-trust-editor">Workspace Trust editor</h2>
    <p>
      The Workspace Trust editor gives you additional control over what you
      trust and will be updated in the 1.58 release to make it easier to
      configure the feature to suit your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because you can customize the behavior, there are many ways to get to
      the Trust Editor 😊. Click the <strong>Restricted Mode</strong> Status bar
      message, the <strong>Manage</strong> link in the Restricted Mode banner,
      the Gear menu, or open the Command Palette (<code>kbstyle(F1)</code>) and
      use the <strong>Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust</strong> command.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Workspace Trust editor, you can trust the current folder, the
      parent folder (and all sub folders), as well as any folder on the machine.

    <p>
      Nobody likes flossing their teeth, but we do it anyway because we know
      it’s the right thing to do. Nobody wants to think about security, but we
      also know it’s the right thing to do. By customizing the experience, you
      can keep your development experience enjoyable while also protecting
      yourself against the threats inherent with development (fun flossing?!?).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people on the VS Code team start out with a top-level folder, where
      they work on sources they trust. For example, on my Mac, I put all the
      sources that I pull from the Microsoft organization on GitHub into my
      <code>~/src</code> folder. I designate <code>~/src</code> as a trusted
      folder and everything beneath it is inherently trusted. When I open
      <code>~/src/vscode</code> or <code>~src/vscode-docker</code>, etc., they
      are opened with full trust because I trust the code that my organization
      writes and consumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve got a separate folder called <code>~/scratch</code> (short for
      “scratchpad”, you can make it whatever you want obviously), where I put
      everything else and assume it is untrusted by default. Then, I make trust
      decisions on a folder-by-folder basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To smooth my workflow, I have the
      <code>"security.workspace.trust.startupPrompt"</code> setting set to
      <code>"never"</code>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="workspace-trust-startup-prompt-setting.png"
        alt="Workspace Trust Startup Prompt setting as never"
      />
      <figcaption>Workspace Trust Startup Prompt setting as never</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      With this setting, I am not prompted by the modal dialog and the workspace
      opens directly in Restricted Mode. I’ve already decided that the
      <code>~src/scratch</code> folder is untrusted, so there is no need to
      prompt me every time I open a subfolder. If I decide that I do trust the
      code I’m reading or writing, I can enable it on the folder with two quick
      clicks (the Restricted Mode notification across the top of VS Code, then
      the Trust button).
    </p>
    <p>
      On my Windows machine, things are a little more interesting. I generally
      work in Ubuntu images running on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL),
      using the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
        >Remote WSL extension</a
      >. I trust the <code>~/src</code> folders on Linux and I trust the
      <code>d:\src</code> folder on the Windows side.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="trust-folders-and-workspaces-list.png"

    </figure>
    <p>
      A few people on the team go one step further and turn off the Restricted
      Mode banner across the top as well (<code
        >"security.workspace.trust.banner": "never"</code
      >), leaving just the Status bar notification. For me this goes too far,
      the banner across the top keeps me honest and helps remind me to be
      vigilant when I am pulling from the internet.
