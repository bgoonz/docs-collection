      The true power of Visual Studio Code is its extensions: theme extensions
      add colors and icons, language extensions enable smart code completion
      (IntelliSense) and navigation, debugger extensions enable you to run your
      code and easily find bugs. There are extensions that play music, some that
      show stock tickers, and there are extensions that enable collaborative
      work across locations and time zones. The VS Code
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">Marketplace</a>
      hosts more than 28,000 extensions and it is not uncommon that users have
      50 or more extensions installed. With so many extensions out there, bugs
      are inevitable. Instead of denial, we want to make troubleshooting easy.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bad-extensions">“Bad” extensions</h2>
    <p>
      We love extensions and don’t really think there are any “bad” extensions.
      However, like all software, extensions have bugs and feature gaps. So, for
      reading ease and artificial drama, let’s use the term “bad extensions”,
      which is an extension that might crash or simply show unwanted behavior.
      Fortunately, we designed VS Code with “bad” extensions in mind and
      therefore run them in a separate
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/extension-host"
        >process</a
      >. This isolation guarantees that VS Code keeps running, the cursor always
      blinks, and that you can always save your work.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fun, and to make it easier to demonstrate extension bisect, we have
      created and published the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jrieken.bisectdemo"
        >Extension Bisect Demo</a
      >
      extension. When installed, it will annoyingly reset your cursor whenever
      you reach the word “bisect”. You can use this extension to follow along in
      this blog post.

    <h2 id="finding-a-bad-extension-the-hard-way">
      Finding a “bad” extension the hard way
    </h2>
    <p>
      Today, finding a “bad” extension can be easy or hard. Open the Extensions
      view (<code>kb(workbench.view.extensions)</code>),
      <a href="/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md#disable-an-extension"
        >disable an extension</a
      >, reload the window (<strong>Developer: Reload Window</strong>), and
      check to see if the problem still exists. If the problem is gone, that
      extension is “bad” and you are done. Otherwise, re-enable the extension
      and repeat the process with the next extension.
    </p>

      />
      <figcaption>Disabling an extension step by step</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If you are lucky, the first extension is the “bad” one; if you are
      unlucky, it’s the last extension. Using computer science language, this
      means with <code>N</code> extensions, you have a worst-case of repeating
      the process <code>O(N)</code> (order N), and an average-case of
      <code>O(N/2)</code>. Because this algorithm is operated by a human (you),
      even small values of <code>N</code> are laborious. This is where the
      <strong>extension bisect</strong> utility comes in handy. It is much
      better in the worst and average cases because it disables extensions by
      halves.
    </p>
    <h2 id="welcome-extension-bisect">Welcome extension bisect</h2>
    <p>
      The Extension bisect utility in VS Code was inspired by the
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a> command. For
      those familiar with Git, this command is helpful for finding out which
      commit in the repository introduced an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s use a sample: I have 24 extensions installed and the 8th extension
      is “bad”. We know that the iterative approach requires 8 steps. What about
      bisect?
    </p>
    <p>
      The video below shows starting extension bisect via the
      <strong>Help: Start Extension Bisect</strong> command and then selecting
      either <strong>Good now</strong> or <strong>This is bad</strong> until the
      “bad” extension is identified. Once identified, you have the option to
      report an issue for that extension.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="bisect.gif" alt="The extension bisect process" />
      <figcaption>The extension bisect process</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Here’s step by step how the “bad” extension was found:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Bisect divides 24 extensions into two halves of 12 extensions each, and
        it disables all 12 extensions of the second half.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this sample, the 8th extension is the “bad” one, so it is the first
        half and not disabled. Things are still not working as we’d expect.
        Because there is still an issue, extension bisect repeats the process,
        dividing the first 12 extensions into two parts: 6 are enabled and 6 are
        disabled. All other extensions are also re-enabled.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 8th extension is now disabled. Things are good now. That means
        bisect can proceed on the second half (extensions 6-11), and divides
        them into 3 enabled and 3 disabled extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, the 8th extension is re-enabled, and the issue has reappeared. This
        means bisect proceeds on the first half. It divides them into 1 enabled
        and 2 disabled extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 8th extension is now disabled, things are good again and bisect
        proceeds on the second half, dividing it into 1 enabled and 1 disabled
        extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 8th extension is the only disabled extension, and the issue is gone.
        This means we have found the “bad” extension and that we are done.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="troubleshoot-faster">Troubleshoot faster</h2>
    <p>
      We see that in each step, bisect reduces the search space by half. The
      steps now it runs in logarithmic time, resulting in average and worst case
      performance of <code>O(log N)</code>. That’s pretty good because it scales
      well. With 24 extensions, you have 4 to 5 steps to find a “bad” extension,
      with 38 extensions, it only takes 1 more step. However, best-case is worse
      because with the iterative approach, you can get lucky and find the “bad”
      in the first round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that extension bisect relies on you giving correct feedback.
      You can easily fool it, and yourself, by always answering
      <strong>Good now</strong> (blames the last extension) or
      <strong>This is bad</strong> (won’t find an extension).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another useful insight is that extension bisect starts off considering the
      full list of enabled extensions. That means you can exclude a known “good”
      extension from bisect by disabling it before starting and by re-enabling
      it after. However, only do that when you are certain that extension isn’t
      the “bad” one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, you might notice that bisect is taking one extra step (<code
        >log2(N) + 1</code
      >). That’s because it starts the first round by disabling all extensions.
      This first step is done because you might be seeing an issue that’s caused
      by VS Code itself, not by an extension, and we don’t want to send you down
      the rabbit hole unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s it. We hope that you never need to use extension bisect. However,
      if you do encounter an issue possibly related to an extension, then we
      hope we can make troubleshooting easier, faster, and more pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>Happy Coding,</p>
