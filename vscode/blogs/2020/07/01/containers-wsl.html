      Using Remote Containers in WSL 2
    </h1>

    <p>
      Leveraging the power of Docker containers and the Windows Subsystem for
      Linux 2 (WSL 2), you can preserve your Windows environment by developing
      your applications in the sandboxed familiarity of a container in a deeply
      integrated Linux kernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      May brought us a couple of exciting announcements in the world of
      virtualization: the Windows 10 May 2020 update added WSL 2 as a feature
      out-of-the-box, and
      <a
        href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/#docker-desktop-community-2302"
        >Docker Desktop Stable 2.3.0.2</a
      >
      went GA with WSL 2 backend support.
    </p>
    <p>
      In
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/03/02/docker-in-wsl2"
        >earlier blog posts</a
      >, we’ve explored how to use Docker in WSL 2. The first requirement was to
      install Windows Insiders, as WSL 2 support was not yet part of stable
      Windows releases, and the next was to install a Tech Preview of Docker WSL
      2. Now, both Windows WSL 2 and Docker support are in stable GA releases!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, we’ll take a look at how both of these tools work, and how
      you can leverage them in Visual Studio Code to productively use remote
      containers in WSL 2.
    </p>
    <h2 id="new-era-of-virtualization">New era of virtualization</h2>
    <p>
      Both WSL 2 and the latest version of Docker Desktop change how
      virtualization works.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wsl-2">WSL 2</h3>
    <p>
      As discussed in a
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2"
        >prior post</a
      >, WSL 2 takes a new approach on the
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-about"
        >Windows Subsystem for Linux</a
      >
      by using a real Linux kernel inside a lightweight virtual machine (VM). It
      has been optimized to feel seamless and deeply integrated into your
      Windows environment so that you have fast boot times, a small resource
      footprint, and no VM configuration or management requirements whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      System calls allow you to perform functions such as accessing files,
      requesting memory, and creating processes. Since WSL 2 includes a complete
      Linux kernel, it has full system call capacity, meaning your favorite apps
      such as Docker will work fully and reliably.
    </p>
    <h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
    <p>
      In WSL 1, due to fundamental differences between Windows and Linux, the
      Docker Engine couldn’t run directly inside WSL, and
      <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hearts-wsl-2/"
        >the Docker team</a
      >
      developed an alternative solution using Hyper-V VMs and LinuxKit. However,
      since WSL 2 now has full system call capacity, Docker can fully run in WSL
      2, which prompted more investment from the Docker team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new May 2020 version of Docker Desktop can build containers much
      faster and consume fewer resources as it leverages WSL 2’s dynamic memory
      allocation. It can take less than 10 seconds to cold start, as opposed to
      almost a minute in the previous version. Additionally, Hyper-V isn’t a
      requirement anymore, so the steps detailed in this post work on Windows 10
      Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since WSL 2 in Windows and Docker Desktop is now GA, you can feel even
      more confident using your remote containers in WSL 2.
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
    <p>Prerequisites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Install Windows 10, version 2004.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To find out which version of Windows your device is running, press
            the <strong>Windows logo</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, type
            <strong>winver</strong> in the <strong>Open</strong> box, and then
            select <strong>OK</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Install
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable WSL 2 by following the
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-install"
          >WSL 2 installation guide</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install Ubuntu (or your preferred Linux distribution) from the <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6"
          >Microsoft store</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install <a
          href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/#download"
          >Docker Desktop Stable 2.3.0.2</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once installed, Docker will recognize that you have WSL installed and
      prompt you to enable WSL integration. Select <strong
        >Enable WSL integration</strong
      >
      from the pop-up window.
    </p>

      />
      <figcaption>Docker Desktop WSL integration dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Optional: Install the new
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/terminal/"
        >Windows Terminal</a
      >
      for the best experience, including the ability to open new PowerShell and
      Ubuntu terminals in the same interface.
    </p>
    <h2 id="open-vs-code-in-wsl-2">Open VS Code in WSL 2</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s connect VS Code to our WSL 2 engine. Open an Ubuntu terminal,
      navigate to the source code folder of your choice, and type
      <code>code .</code>. This will launch an instance of VS Code that lets you
      use WSL as your full-time development environment. You can also connect to
      WSL from the Command Palette. I’m going to open a simple
      <a href="https://github.com/bamurtaugh/HelloNode">HelloNode</a>
      application:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="2-ubuntu-launch.png" alt="Launch code . from Ubuntu terminal" />
      <figcaption>Launch code . from Ubuntu terminal</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Once VS Code opens, it recognizes that we have WSL installed, and
      recommends we install the <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
        >Remote - WSL</a
      > extension. I’ll select <strong>Install</strong>:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="3-wsl-extension-recommended.png"
        alt="Remote - WSL extension recommended"
      />
      <figcaption>Remote - WSL extension recommended</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      After installing the extension, we can reload VS Code to connect to WSL 2:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="4-reload-vscode.png"
        alt="Reload VS Code after installing extension"
      />
      <figcaption>Reload VS Code after installing extension</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Once we’ve reloaded, we can confirm that we’re connected to Ubuntu by
      checking the WSL indicator in the bottom-left corner of the window:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="5-wsl-left-indicator.png"
        alt="WSL: Ubuntu bottom left indicator"
      />
      <figcaption>WSL: Ubuntu bottom left indicator</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Installing the Remote - WSL extension added the Remote Explorer to VS
      Code. When we look inside the Explorer, we can see information about our
      Linux distros:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="6-remote-explorer-wsl-targets.png"
        alt="Remote Explorer with WSL Targets"
      />
      <figcaption>Remote Explorer with WSL Targets</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="working-with-containers">Working with containers</h2>
    <p>
      We can leverage the
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers"
        >Remote - Containers</a
      >
      extension to view and attach to containers, in addition to a variety of
      other scenarios, such as: *
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial"
        >Developing within a set of sample containers</a
      >
      *
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container"
        >Opening existing source code in a container</a
      >
      *
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume"
        >Working with a GitHub repository</a
      >
      in an isolated container volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      These configurations allow you to easily recreate the same development
      environment across machines, install tools and extensions specific to a
      project into a DevContainer, and develop in a setup similar to the
      environment for deployment, leaving the local machine unchanged. We can
      also view and attach to containers using the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
        >Docker</a
      >
      extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you can access source code from both Windows and the WSL 2
      filesystem when using the WSL 2 engine, we recommend using the WSL 2 file
      system because
      <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-desktop-wsl-2-best-practices/"
        >performance is much better</a
      >. Since the performance is better when using the filesystem inside WSL 2,
      let’s walk through how to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to select the folder we want to open in a container. First, make
      sure you’ve installed the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"
        >Remote - Containers</a
      >
      extension. We can then call the <strong
        >Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container</strong
      > command from a folder already opened using the Remote - WSL extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an existing HelloNode folder on my WSL 2 filesystem with my Node
      project in it. I’ll select:
      <strong>Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container…</strong>:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="7-reopen-container.png"
        alt="Command Palette: Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container…"
      />
      <figcaption>
        Command Palette: Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container…
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      A list of container definitions will appear, since there is no
      DevContainer configuration in the repository yet. The list of container
      configuration definitions that appears is filtered based on my project
      type. I’ll select <strong>Node.js 14</strong>:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="8-node-14.png" alt="Command Palette: Node.js 14" />
      <figcaption>Command Palette: Node.js 14</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      A new instance of VS Code opens. VS Code starts building the image, and
      then starts our container:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="9-vscode-starting-with-container.png"
        alt="VS Code instance starting with Dev Container"
      />
      <figcaption>VS Code instance starting with Dev Container</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Our application now has a .devcontainer folder in which the container
      configuration information is stored. To double-check we’re connected to
      both WSL and within a container, let’s open the integrated terminal and
      check for the <code>uname</code> and version of Node:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="10-uname-node.png" alt="Check uname and node -v" />
      <figcaption>Check uname and node -v</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      As we can see, our <code>uname</code> came back as Linux, so we are still
      connected to the WSL 2 engine, and <code>node -v</code> returned v14.4.0,
      so we have successfully configured our Node 14 container.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s try running our app with <strong>F5</strong>:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="11-localhost-hello-world.png"
        alt="Local host running Hello World app"
      />
      <figcaption>Local host running Hello World app</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Success!</p>
