      Introducing GitHub Issues Integration

    <p>
      On the Visual Studio Code team, we use GitHub
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues">issues</a> to track
      all of our work. From our detailed
      <a
        href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aiteration-plan"
        >iteration plans</a
      >
      to individual bugs, we track everything as GitHub issues. Given how
      important issues are to our team and other GitHub projects, we wanted to
      add GitHub issues integration to VS Code. This addition complemented the
      GitHub Pull Request work we
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/09/10/introducing-github-pullrequests"
        >announced</a
      >
      over a year ago. Starting with VS Code version 1.45, this new support to
      move the issues and source code closer together will be available in the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github"
        >GitHub Pull Requests and Issues</a
      >
      extension (formerly named GitHub Pull Requests).
    </p>
    <h2 id="our-integration-approach">Our integration approach</h2>
    <p>
      Issues and pull requests often go hand in hand, so including them in the
      same
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github"
        >GitHub Pull Requests and Issues</a
      >
      extension was a logical step as much of the same
      <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">GitHub API</a> is needed for
      both issues and pull requests. We did not want to add GitHub functionality
      directly to the core VS Code editor because there are many source control
      options. Instead, we will recommend the extension when we detect that a
      user’s open repository uses GitHub. By working with our own
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api"
        >extension API</a
      >, we ensure the API has the features that extension authors need, and
      other repository providers can implement similar integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was important that we not prescribe overly specific workflows. Instead,
      our goal was to bring issues into the inner development loop in a flexible
      way. For example, giving more context for an issue in a code comment is
      part of that goal, but adding full issue management into VS Code doesn’t
      fit as well. We don’t want to reinvent UI that GitHub already does well.
      We <strong>do</strong> want to make connections that aren’t already there.
    </p>
    <h2 id="issues-in-the-code-context">Issues in the code context</h2>
    <p>
      Linking to issues in source code is a normal part of our workflow,
      especially when there’s some logic that’s difficult to understand or when
      there’s a //TODO comment that needs action. If you do a
      <a
        href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/search?q=%22Microsoft%2Fvscode%2Fissues%22"
        >search for issue references</a
      >
      in the VS Code repo, you’ll see plenty of issues mentioned. While linking
      gives a pointer to more information, to actually learn more you need to
      leave the editor. Now, by gaining this issue context through hovers, you
      don’t need to break your flow to learn more.
    </p>

      <img src="issue-hover.png" alt="Issue Hover" />
      <figcaption>Issue Hover</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Issue hovers work on full issue URLs, issue comment URLs, issues
      referenced by number (<code>#1234</code>), and issues referenced by
      <code>owner/repository#1234</code> (for example
      <code>Microsoft/vscode#1234</code>). We also often reference users in our
      codebase. The VS Code
      <a
        href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/d8317abc50e347d76fd471f5a070996cc7f73e20/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts"
        >proposed API</a
      >
      has many developer references to make it obvious who’s responsible for the
      proposals.

    <p>
      Issue context is typically needed in commit messages to reference an issue
      the commit resolves, within source code files, and in Markdown (such as a
      changelog). To easily add this context, we have added completion
      suggestions for issues and users. In the Git commit textbox, you can
      format your issue completion with the
      <code>githubIssues.issueCompletionFormatScm</code> setting. In Markdown
      files, issues complete as a Markdown link, and in other files, issues
      complete as a simple issue number (<code>#1234</code>).

    </figure>
    <p>
      The list of possible issues is configurable with the setting
      <code>githubIssues.queries</code>, so if you work across multiple
      repositories, you can include queries for those issues. The queries use
      the
      <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax"
        >GitHub search syntax</a
      >. The list of users includes the collaborators in the currently open
      repository.

      Creating an issue from anywhere
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we find a bug in VS Code while working on some source code, we create
      an issue and assign it to whoever owns that area. Or, if the finder of the
      bug is also the owner, we’ll often leave a //TODO comment as a reminder to
      come back to it. Having //TODOs scattered throughout the codebase is hard
      to keep track of when you have many contributors (though it’s safe to say
      that we’ve all done it), but creating an issue and referencing it in the
      //TODO is trackable. To reduce the barrier and context loss when creating
      an issue while you’re deep in the source, there are a few new ways to
      create issues:
    </p>
    <p>
      From a //TODO comment (configurable with
      <code>githubIssues.createIssueTriggers</code>), you can create and assign
      an issue without leaving VS Code.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="create-from-todo.gif" alt="Create Issue from TODO" />
      <figcaption>Create Issue from TODO</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      And from a selection, you can quickly create an issue with a permalink
      back to the source code where it originated, using the
      <strong>GitHub Issues: Create Issue from Selection</strong> command. If
      you just need a pointer to some code, you can also use the
      <strong>GitHub Issues: Copy GitHub Permalink</strong> command. Finally, if
      there is failure information in the terminal, you can just copy the output
      to the clipboard and create an issue using
      <strong>GitHub Issues: Create Issue from Clipboard</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="working-on-issues">Working on issues</h2>
    <p>
      A common workflow is to look at your issues, pick one to work on, create a
      branch to work in, make some commits, then merge your changes back into
      main with a pull request. From the new <strong>Issues</strong> view, you
      can do exactly that.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="work-on-issue.gif" alt="Work on an Issue" />
      <figcaption>Work on an Issue</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      To fit more workflows, there are several options you can configure. If
      your flow doesn’t involve creating a topic branch, you can disable the
      branch creation with <code>githubIssues.useBranchForIssues</code>. If you
      have a different naming scheme for your branches, you can use the
      <code>githubIssues.issueBranchTitle</code> setting. The issues listed in
      the <strong>Issues</strong> view can be configured to use a custom query
      with <code>githubIssues.queries</code>.

      Currently, most of these features are only supported in repository clones
      (not forks), so there is more work to be done to support that and other
      use cases. We would love to see your feedback for this extension, so feel
      free to leave us a suggestion in the issues in the extension
