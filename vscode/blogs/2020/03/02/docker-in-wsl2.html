      Last June, the Docker team
      <a href="https://engineering.docker.com/2019/06/docker-hearts-wsl-2/"
        >announced</a
      >
      that they will be investing in getting Docker running with the Windows
      Subsystem for Linux (WSL). All of this is made possible with the recent
      changes to the architecture of WSL to run within a lightweight virtual
      machine (VM), which we talked about in an earlier
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2"
        >blog post about WSL 2</a
      >. Since this announcement, the Docker team has released a
      <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/"
        >Technical Preview</a
      >
      of Docker that includes support for running with WSL 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article explains how the Docker Desktop technical preview works as
      well as how to use the Docker extension with the technical preview.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
    <p>
      This new Docker architecture works a lot like Visual Studio Code’s
      <a href="/docs/remote/wsl.md">WSL remote development</a> support in that
      the Docker CLI running on the host machine executes commands within the
      Docker Integration Package, which runs on the remote WSL VM.
    </p>

    <p>
      DockerD runs directly within WSL so there’s no need for the Hyper-V VM and
      all Linux containers run within the Linux userspace on Windows for
      improved performance and compatibility.
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h2>
    <p>First some prerequisites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Install Windows 10 Insider Preview build 18975 (Slow) or later for WSL
        2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install Ubuntu from the
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6"
          >Microsoft store</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable WSL 2 by following this
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-install">guide</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install the
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
          >Remote - WSL</a
        >
        extension for VS Code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install the
        <a
          href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/#download"
          >Docker WSL 2 Technical Preview</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once installed, Docker will recognize that you have WSL installed and
      prompt to enable WSL integration. You want to
      <strong>Enable WSL integration</strong> for this tutorial.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="docker-desktop-wsl-integration.png"
        alt="Docker Desktop WSL integration dialog"
      />
      <figcaption>Docker Desktop WSL integration dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This option will allow you to access Docker Desktop via the Docker CLI
      directly from within your Linux distro.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have multiple Linux distros, make sure you only have WSL
      integration turned on for the correct one in your Docker settings:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="docker-resources-wsl-integration.png"
        alt="Docker settings dialog"
      />
      <figcaption>Docker settings dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      With that configured, all commands will execute in the Linux context -
      this includes Docker commands run from PowerShell so running something
      like <code>docker run mongo…</code> will start a Linux container within
      the WSL VM.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="docker-run-mongo.png" alt="docker run mongo command" />
      <figcaption>docker run mongo command</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Running the <code>docker ps</code> command over in WSL, you’ll see the
      container as expected. Notice that the container ID matches.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="docker-ps-in-wsl.png" alt="docker ps command in WSL" />
      <figcaption>docker ps command in WSL</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="using-vs-code">Using VS Code</h2>
    <p>
      With this set up and running, you can install the VS Code
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
        >Docker</a
      >
      extension and access your containers. If you’re already running WSL 2 and
      the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
        >Remote - WSL</a
      >
      extension, this will help you get Docker integrated into your WSL workflow
      rather than switching contexts when you need containers. And because the
      Docker CLI’s context is set to use DockerD in WSL, the extension will work
      with your containers regardless of whether you opened VS Code using the
      Remote - WSL extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how in the screenshot below, I’m connected and working in WSL and
      still building/running containers without changing from my preferred
      environment (zsh in Ubuntu).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="vscode-containers-in-wsl.png"
        alt="VS Code working with containers in WSL"
      />

    </figure>

    <p>
      I’ve personally noticed a vast improvement in container execution times
      using this configuration and each part of my typical development workflow
      remains the same. I’m also using the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"
        >Remote - Containers</a
      >
      extension within WSL for testing specific environments without setting
      things up directly on my machine.
    </p>
    <h2 id="we-want-your-feedback">We want your feedback</h2>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that you’re using prerelease software and, while the Windows
      Insiders Slow ring is very stable, you may run into some issues. If you do
      find something that isn’t working as expected, please open an issue via
      the Feedback tool in Windows. Any direct Docker issues or feedback can be
      logged in the
      <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues">Docker for Windows</a>
      repo.
    </p>
    <p>Happy Coding!</p>
