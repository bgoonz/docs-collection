      The next phase of the Go experience

      From the beginning, we have worked with developer communities to build
      Visual Studio Code as a powerful, extensible editor. Five years into this
      journey, individuals and organizations in our community have helped us
      create an editor that is really for all developers, using any language.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many of our 11 million users, VS Code is their primary code editor, as
      is the case for 41% of developers that are working with Go (according to
      the
      <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results"
        >Go developer survey</a
      >). We are proud of the work that we have done on the
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go"
        >Go extension for Visual Studio Code</a
      >, which is the result of an extensive development effort together with
      the Go community by virtue of both code contributions and integration with
      over a dozen independently maintained tools.

      Last year, we worked with the Go team to enable support for a new language
      server for the Go language,
      <a href="https://golang.org/s/gopls">gopls</a>, and improving support for
      the
      <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/1515">Delve</a>
      debugger. Using the new language server improves the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFJfdWzBHwE">experience</a> of Go
      developers working with VS Code. It offers an integrated solution for
      various components of the core developer experience (code completion, jump
      to definition, hover tooltips, etc.) through a tool that is maintained by
      the Go project itself and is kept up to date with support for new language
      features such as Go modules.

      The Go extension for VS Code joins the Go project
    </h2>
    <p>
      Today we are happy to announce that the Go team has officially stepped up
      as the <strong>new maintainer of the Go extension</strong>. During the
      last few years working together with the Go team, it’s been clear they are
      in the best position to advance the tooling ecosystem for Go and ensure
      that it evolves alongside the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Go and Visual Studio Code teams recognize the importance of
      Visual Studio Code to the Go community and believe strongly in an open
      tooling ecosystem for Go developers. Even as the extension graduates to be
      part of the Go project, the VS Code team will continue to work together
      with the rest of the Go project and the community to deliver a great
      experience for all <em>Gophers</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the Go project will also ensure that the community is
      engaged on every step along the way. The extension currently depends on
      many different tools that are maintained by the community, and we want to
      work with the owners of those projects to help reduce the burden of
      maintenance work on the Go community.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practical terms, as the extension graduates to being part of the Go
      project, we will be changing the publisher of the extension from
      “Microsoft” to “Go Team at Google” in the VS Code Marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the source code repository for the extension is changing to
      join the rest of the Go project at
      <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go">golang/vscode-go</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst our community of contributors, we’d like to extend special thanks
      to Ramya Rao (<span class="citation" data-cites="ramyanexus"
        >[@ramyanexus]</span
      >(https://twitter.com/ramyanexus/)), the lead maintainer of the extension
      and contributor to the community for many years, as well as Luke Hoban
      (<span class="citation" data-cites="lukehoban">[@lukehoban]</span
      >(https://twitter.com/lukehoban/)) and Erich Gamma (<span

      September 2015! We would also like to thank Rebecca Stambler (<span

      If you need assistance with the Go extension for VS Code, you can connect
      with our team members on the <code>#vscode</code> channel on the
      <a href="https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org">Gophers Slack</a>.
      Conversations between Go team members working on the extension will take
      place in the <code>#vscode-dev</code> channel in the same Slack workspace,
      and we welcome discussion on issues and contributions from all community
      members.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all of us in the Visual Studio Code and Go teams, we are excited for
      the future ahead and for the ability to work together to deliver
      world-class tooling to every developer working with Go, and we look
      forward continue collaborating with the community.
