      Visual Studio Code is a source code editor first and foremost with rich
      editing <a href="/docs/editor/codebasics.md">features</a>. In this
      document, we will go through a few Java-specific features, which are
      helpful when working with Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you run into any issues when using the features below, you can contact
      us by clicking the <strong>Report an issue</strong> button below.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="code-navigation">Code navigation</h2>
    <p>
      With the
      <a href="/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md#outline-view">Outline view</a>,
      you can conveniently navigate your methods within the same class.
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md#project-view">Project view</a> also
      provide a great overview of your project. As a Java editor, it also
      supports CodeLens (references) and Javadoc hovers and highlights out of
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you open your Java project or any source files with VS Code, all code
      navigation features as well as syntax check and documentation (hover to
      see Javadoc) would be available immediately by its
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md#lightweight-mode">Lightweight Mode</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="search-for-symbols">Search for symbols</h3>
    <p>
      You can search for symbols in the current file or workspace to navigate
      your code more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To search for a symbol in the current file, use
      <strong>Quick Open</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)</code>)
      then enter the ‘@’ command, then enter the name of the symbol you’re
      looking for. A list of potential matches will appear and be filtered as
      you type. Choose from the list of matches to navigate to its location.
    </p>

        type="video/mp4"
      />
    </video>
    <p>
      To search for a symbol in the current workspace, start by pressing
      <code>kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)</code>, then enter the name of
      the symbol. A list of potential matches will appear as before. If you
      choose a match that was found in a file that’s not already open, the file
      will be opened before navigating to the match’s location. Alternatively,
      you can also use
      <strong>Quick Open</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)</code>)
      then enter the ‘#’ command to search the current workspace.
      <code>kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)</code> is just the shortcut for
      the ‘#’ commands, so everything works the same.
    </p>

      />
    </video>
    <h3 id="peek-definition">Peek Definition</h3>
    <p>
      You can take a quick look at how a symbol was defined by using the Peek
      Definition feature. This feature displays a few lines of code near the
      definition inside a peek window, so you can take a look without navigating
      away from your current location.
    </p>
    <p>
      To peek at a symbol’s definition, place your cursor on the symbol anywhere
      it’s used in your source code and then press
      <code>kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)</code>. Alternatively, you can
      choose <strong>Peek Definition</strong> from the context menu
      (right-click, then choose <strong>Peek Definition</strong>).
    </p>
    <h3 id="go-to-definition">Go to Definition</h3>
    <p>
      You can also quickly navigate to where a symbol is defined by using the Go
      to Definition feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go to a symbol’s definition, place your cursor on the symbol anywhere
      it is used in your source code and then press
      <code>kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)</code>. Alternatively, you can
      choose <strong>Go to Definition</strong> from the context menu
      (right-click, then choose <strong>Go to Definition</strong>). When there’s
      only one definition of the symbol, you’ll navigate directly to its
      location, otherwise the competing definitions are displayed in a peek
      window as described in the previous section and you have to choose the
      definition that you want to go to.
    </p>
    <h3 id="go-to-super-implementation">Go to Super Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      You can keep track of class implementations and overriding methods by
      clicking the <strong>Go to Super Implementation</strong> link on hover.

    <h3 id="call-hierarchy">Call Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>
      A Call Hierarchy view shows all calls from or to a function and allows you
      to drill into callers of callers and call of calls. Right-click on a
      function and select <strong>Peek</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Peek Call Hierarchy</strong>.

        >Smart Selection</a
      >
      (semantic selection), you can expand or shrink the selection range based
      on the semantic information of the caret position in your source code.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To expand the selection, use
        <code>kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        To shrink the selection, use
        <code>kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)</code>.

    <h3 id="semantic-highlighting">Semantic Highlighting</h3>
    <p>
      Syntax highlighting is a very important feature that allows you to read
      code more efficiently. With the help of
      <a
        href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Semantic-Highlighting-Overview"
        >Semantic Highlighting</a
      >, VS Code can provide more accurate source code coloring based on symbol
      information from the Java language service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is just one example, left is the behavior after enabling semantic
      highlighting and right is the one with only syntax highlighting.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Semantic Highlighting</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      To enable semantic highlighting, you can toggle the
      <code>java.semanticHighlighting.enabled</code> setting. You will also be
      prompted to enable or disable semantic highlighting on startup:

    <h2 id="code-editing">Code editing</h2>
    <p>
      Editing code is also easy with IntelliSense for smart code completions and
      signature details. You can use code snippets as well as various code
      actions such as generating Getters/Setters and organizing imports to
      further boost your productivity.

      Java support in Visual Studio Code detects issues within your code
      automatically, and provides you with Quick Fix suggestions.

      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="intellisense">IntelliSense</h3>
    <p>
      Code completion in Visual Studio Code for Java is provided by
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java"
        >Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat</a
      >. The extension is powered by the same
      <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/">Java development tools (JDT)</a>
      behind Eclipse, so you can expect the same level of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, there’s also AI-assisted IntelliSense called
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/"
        >IntelliCode</a
      >. It saves you time by putting what you’re most likely to use at the top
      of your completion list. IntelliCode recommendations are based on
      thousands of open-source projects on GitHub each with over 100 stars, so
      it’s trained on the most common usages from high quality projects. When
      combined with the context of your code, the completion list is tailored to
      promote those practices. Here’s IntelliCode for Java in action.
    </p>
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls>
      <source src="/docs/java/java-editing/intellicode.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

    <p>
      IntelliCode works well with popular Java libraries and frameworks like
      Java SE and Spring. It will help you whether you are doing monolithic web
      apps or modern microservices.
    </p>
    <h3 id="create-new-file">Create new file</h3>
    <p>
      VS Code supports applying templates when you create a Java source file.
      When you create a <code>.java</code> file in the File Explorer, the
      language server will automatically generate the class body, and fill the
      package info for you:

    <h2 id="code-snippets">Code snippets</h2>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of popular Java code snippets to
      make you more productive, such as class/interface, syserr, sysout,
      if/else, try/catch, static main method. Leveraging information from Java
      language server, it also provides a preview of the code snippet during the
      selection.
