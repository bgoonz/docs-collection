Prerequisites
-------------

A working Java environment with essential extensions installed is needed, including:

-   [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/), version 11 or later.
-   [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), version 3.0 or later.
-   [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

For more details, please refer to [Java Tutorial](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#before-you-begin)

> **Note**: More information about JDK can be found at [supported Java versions](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#supported-java-versions).

Create the project
------------------

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to search for dependencies and generate new Spring Boot projects.

To install, launch VS Code and from the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`), search for `vscode-spring-initializr`.

Once you have the extension installed, open the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and type `Spring Initializr` to start generating a Maven or Gradle project and then follow the wizard.

Edit the project
----------------

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to edit dependencies after generating a new Spring Boot project.

Navigate to your `pom.xml` file and right-click to select `Edit starters`. The **Command Palette** will show the dependencies you already have beginning with a `√` . You can search for other dependencies you want to add to your project. Or you can click on the existing dependencies to remove them.

Develop the application
-----------------------

The [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot) extension includes rich language support for working with Spring Boot `application.properties`, `application.yml`, and `.java` files.

The extension supports quick navigate through source code, smart code completions, quick access to running apps, live application information, and code templates. Similar code completion and validation features are also available for `.properties` and `.yml` files.

Run the application
-------------------

In addition to click `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to run your application, there’s another convenient extension [Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard) with which you can view and manage all available Spring Boot projects in your workspace as well as quickly start, stop, or debug your project.
