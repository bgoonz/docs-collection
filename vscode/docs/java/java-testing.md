Testing Java with Visual Studio Code
====================================

Testing Java in Visual Studio Code is enabled by the [Java Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test) extension. It’s a lightweight extension to run and debug Java test cases. The extension supports the following test frameworks:

-   [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) (v4.8.0+)
-   [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) (v5.1.0+)
-   [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) (v6.8.0+)

> **Note**: More information about the test frameworks can be found at [JUnit](https://junit.org/) and [TestNG](https://testng.org/).

The [Java Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test) works with the [Language Support for Java by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) and [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) extensions to provide the following features:

-   Run/Debug test cases
-   Customize test configurations
-   View test report
-   View tests in Test Explorer
-   Show test logs

Quickstart
----------

Make sure you have the below tools available already

-   JDK (version 11 or later)
-   VS Code (version 1.23.0 or later)
-   [Language Support for Java by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
-   [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)

You may refer to [Java Extensions](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#before-you-begin) to set up the environment.

> **Note**: More information about JDK can be found at [supported Java versions](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md#supported-java-versions).

### Getting Started for JUnit 5

Please refer to [Getting Started](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#overview-getting-started) from the JUnit 5 official documentation.

> **Note**: You can use [junit-platform-console-standalone.jar](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.junit.platform%20AND%20a:junit-platform-console-standalone) in projects that manually manage their dependencies similar to the [plain-old JAR known from JUnit 4](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install#plain-old-jar).

### Getting Started for JUnit 4

Please refer to [Download and Install](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install) from the JUnit 4 official documentation.

### Getting Started for TestNG

Please refer to [TestNG Docs](https://testng.org/doc/) from the TestNG official documentation.

### Run|Debug CodeLens

When you open a project with test cases from supported frameworks, Test Runner will be activated and you will find **Run|Debug** on the CodeLens of your test functions. Click on the CodeLens to run the individual test case. You can also access and run a group of test cases from the Test Explorer. For more information on debugging test cases, see [Debugging Java](/docs/java/java-debugging.md).

Here’s a brief session with TestNG:

Run/Debug Test Cases
--------------------

![Run from Codelens](images/java-testing/run_codelens.png)

-   The extension will generate **Run Test** and **Debug Test** shortcuts (also known as CodeLens) above the class and method definition. Select them to start running or debugging the target test cases.

> Note: If you cannot see the CodeLens in your editor, please refer to this [issue comment](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-test/issues/470#issuecomment-444681714) as a workaround.

Test Explorer
-------------

![Run from Explorer](images/java-testing/run_explorer.png)

-   The Test Explorer is the place to show all the test cases in your project. You can also run/debug your test cases from here.
-   Click the node in the Test Explorer will navigate to the location of the source code.

> Note: If the Test Explorer is empty, please refer to this [issue comment](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-test/issues/470#issuecomment-444681714) as a workaround.

Customize Test Configurations
-----------------------------

![Configuration](images/java-testing/configuration.png)

-   Sometimes you may want to customize the configuration for running the test cases. To achieve this, you can add it into your workspace settings under the section: `java.test.config`.

> Note: More details can be found in [Run with Configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-test/wiki/Run-with-Configuration).

View Test Report
----------------

![Status Bar](images/java-testing/status_bar.png)

-   After running/debugging the test cases, the test report is opened automatically. You can also see the final results in the status bar, by clicking on it to show the Test Report.
-   You can also click the ✔️ or ❌ mark in the CodeLens to open the Test Report.

![Report Navigation](images/java-testing/report_navigate.png)

-   For a quick peek of the test status or results, you can see them in the Test Explorer directly.

-   You can navigate to the source location of the target test case by clicking the navigate button.

JUnit5 Support
--------------

The JUnit 5 support covers frequently used annotations such as `@DisplayName`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@TestFactory`, `@TestTemplate`, and `@Nested`. It also supports meta-annotations and composed annotations.
