      Why are my files corrupted on format?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Files can be corrupted due to the fact that you either have a multi-root
      workspace where one folder is a child of the other, or you are using
      symlinks to open your file. Reduce the folders in the workspace to one and
      remove the symlink. This should fix your problem.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-get-intellisense-to-work-correctly">
      How do I get IntelliSense to work correctly?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Without any configuration, the extension will attempt to locate headers by
      searching your workspace folder and by emulating a compiler it finds on
      your computer. (for example cl.exe/WSL/MinGW for Windows, gcc/clang for
      macOS/Linux). If this automatic configuration is insufficient, you can
      modify the defaults by running the
      <strong>C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)</strong> command. In that view,
      you can change the compiler you want to emulate, the paths to include
      files you want to use, preprocessor definitions, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, if you install a build system extension that interfaces with our
      extension, you can allow that extension to provide the configurations for
      you. For example, the CMake Tools extension can configure projects that
      use the CMake build system. Use the
      <strong>C/C++: Change Configuration Provider…</strong> command to enable
      any such extension to provide the configurations for IntelliSense.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third option for projects without build system extension support is to
      use a
      <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html"
        >compile_commands.json</a
      >
      file if your build system supports generating this file. In the “Advanced”
      section of the Configuration UI, you can supply the path to your
      <code>compile_commands.json</code> and the extension will use the
      compilation information listed in that file to configure IntelliSense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If the extension is unable to resolve any of the
      <code>#include</code> directives in your source code, it will not show
      linting information for the body of the source file. If you check the
      <strong>Problems</strong> window in VS Code, the extension will provide
      more information about which files it was unable to locate. If you want to
      show the linting information anyway, you can change the value of the
      <code>C_Cpp.errorSquiggles</code> setting.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-do-i-see-red-squiggles-under-standard-library-types">
      Why do I see red squiggles under Standard Library types?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most common reason for this is missing include paths and defines. The
      easiest way to fix this on each platform is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Linux/Mac</strong>: Set
      <code>intelliSenseMode": "clang-x64</code> or
      <code>intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64</code> and <code>compilerPath</code> in
      <strong>c_cpp_properties.json</strong> to the path to your compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Windows</strong>: If you are using the Microsoft C++ compiler, set
      <code>intelliSenseMode": "msvc-x64</code>, but don’t add the
      <code>compilerPath</code> property to
      <strong>c_cpp_properties.json</strong>. If you are using Clang for
      Windows, set <code>intelliSenseMode": "msvc-x64</code>, and
      <code>compilerPath</code> in <strong>c_cpp_properties.json</strong> to the
      path to your compiler.

    <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-includepath-and-browse.path">
      What is the difference between includePath and browse.path?
    </h2>
    <p>
      These two settings are available in <code>c_cpp_properties.json</code> and
      can be confusing.
    </p>
    <h3 id="includepath">includePath</h3>
    <p>
      This array of path strings is used by the “Default” IntelliSense engine.
      This new engine provides semantic-aware IntelliSense features and will be
      the eventual replacement for the Tag Parser that has been powering the
      extension since it was first released. It currently provides tooltips and
      error squiggles in the editor. The remaining features (for example, code
      completion, signature help, Go to Definition, …) are implemented using the
      Tag Parser’s database, so it is still important to ensure that the
      browse.path setting is properly set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paths that you specify for this setting are the same paths that you
      would send to your compiler via the <code>-I</code> switch. When your
      source files are parsed, the IntelliSense engine will prepend these paths
      to the files specified by your #include directives while attempting to
      resolve them. These paths are <strong>not</strong> searched recursively.
    </p>
    <h3 id="browse.path">browse.path</h3>
    <p>
      This array of path strings is used by the “Tag Parser” (“browse engine”).
      This engine will <strong>recursively</strong> enumerate all files under
      the paths specified and track them as potential includes while tag parsing
      your project folder. To disable recursive enumeration of a path, you can
      append a <code>/*</code> to the path string.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open a workspace for the first time, the extension adds
      <code>${workspaceFolder}</code> to both arrays. If this is undesirable,
      you can open your <strong>c_cpp_properties.json</strong> file and remove
      it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-recreate-the-intellisense-database">
      How do I recreate the IntelliSense database?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Starting in version 0.12.3 of the extension, there is a command to reset
      your IntelliSense database. Open the Command Palette
      (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>) and choose the
      <strong>C/C++: Reset IntelliSense Database</strong> command.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-ipch-folder">What is the ipch folder?</h2>
    <p>
      The language server caches information about included header files to
      improve the performance of IntelliSense. When you edit C/C++ files in your
      workspace folder, the language server will store cache files in the
      <code>ipch</code> folder. By default, the <code>ipch</code> folder is
      stored under the user directory. Specifically, it is stored under
      <code>%LocalAppData%/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools</code> on Windows, and for
      Linux and macOS it is under <code>~/.vscode-cpptools</code>. By using the
      user directory as the default path, it will create one cache location per
      user for the extension. As the cache size limit is applied to a cache
      location, having one cache location per user will limit the disk space
      usage of the cache to that one folder for everyone using the default
      setting value.
    </p>
    <p>
      VS Code per-workspace storage folders were not used because the location
      provided by VS Code is not well known and we didn’t want to write GB’s of
      files where users may not see them or know where to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, we knew that we would not be able to meet the needs of
      every different development environment, so we provided settings to allow
      you to customize the way that works best for your situation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="c_cpp.intellisensecachepath-string">
      <code>"C_Cpp.intelliSenseCachePath": &lt;string&gt;</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This setting allows you to set workspace or global overrides for the cache
      path. For example, if you want to share a single cache location for all
      workspace folders, open the VS Code settings, and add a User setting for
      <strong>IntelliSense Cache Path</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="c_cpp.intellisensecachesize-number">
      <code>"C_Cpp.intelliSenseCacheSize": &lt;number&gt;</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This setting allows you to set a limit on the amount of caching the
      extension does. This is an approximation, but the extension will make a
      best effort to keep the cache size as close to the limit you set as
      possible. If you are sharing the cache location across workspaces as
      explained above, you can still increase/decrease the limit, but you should
      make sure that you add a User setting for
      <strong>IntelliSense Cache Size</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-disable-the-intellisense-cache-ipch">
      How do I disable the IntelliSense cache (ipch)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you do not want to use the IntelliSense caching feature that improves
      the performance of IntelliSense, you can disable the feature by setting
      the <strong>IntelliSense Cache Size</strong> setting to 0 (or
      <code>"C_Cpp.intelliSenseCacheSize": 0"</code> in the JSON settings
      editor).
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-set-up-debugging">How do I set up debugging?</h2>
    <p>
      The debugger needs to be configured to know which executable and debugger
      to use:
    </p>
    <p>
      From the main menu, select <strong>Run</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Add Configuration…</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file <code>launch.json</code> will now be open for editing with a new
      configuration. The default settings will <em>probably</em> work except
      that you need to specify the <code>program</code> setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      See
      <a href="/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference.md">Debug configuration</a> for
      more in-depth documentation on how to configure the debugger.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-enable-debug-symbols">How do I enable debug symbols?</h2>
    <p>
      Enabling debug symbols is dependent on the type of compiler you are using.
      Below are some of the compilers and the compiler options necessary to
      enable debug symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in doubt, please check your compiler’s documentation for the options
      necessary to include debug symbols in the output. This may be some variant
      of <code>-g</code> or <code>--debug</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="clang-c">Clang (C++)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you invoke the compiler manually, add the
        <code>--debug</code> option.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re using a script, make sure the
        <code>CXXFLAGS</code> environment variable is set. For example,
        <code>export CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} --debug"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re using CMake, make sure the <code>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</code> is
        set. For example, <code>export CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=${CXXFLAGS}</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="clang-c-1">Clang (C)</h3>
    <p>
      See Clang C++ but use <code>CFLAGS</code> instead of
      <code>CXXFLAGS</code>.
