    <p>
      Visual Studio Code takes security seriously and wants to help you safely
      browse and edit code no matter the source or original authors. The
      Workspace Trust feature lets you decide whether your project folders
      should allow or restrict automatic code execution.
    </p>

    <h2 id="safe-code-browsing">Safe code browsing</h2>
    <p>
      It’s great that there is so much source code available on public
      repositories and file shares. No matter the coding task or problem, there
      is probably already a good solution available somewhere. It is also great
      that there are so many powerful coding tools available to help you
      understand, debug, and optimize your code. However, using open-source code
      and tools does have risks, and you can leave yourself open to malicious
      code execution and exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workspace Trust provides an extra layer of security when working with
      unfamiliar code, by preventing automatic code execution when a workspace
      is open in “Restricted Mode”.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: The terms “workspace” and “folder” are used
        widely in the VS Code UI and documentation. You can think of a
        <a href="/docs/editor/workspaces.md">“workspace”</a> as a folder with
        extra metadata created and used by VS Code.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="restricted-mode">Restricted Mode</h2>
    <p>
      When prompted by the Workspace Trust dialog, if you choose
      <strong>No, I don’t trust the authors</strong>, VS Code will go into
      Restricted Mode to prevent code execution. The workbench will display a
      banner at the top with links to <strong>Manage</strong> your folder via
      the Workspace Trust editor, and <strong>Learn More</strong> about
      Workspace Trust (which takes you to back to this documentation).
    </p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>Workspace Trust Restricted Mode Status bar badge</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Restricted Mode tries to prevent automatic code execution by disabling or
      limiting the operation of several VS Code features: tasks, debugging,
      workspace settings, and extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the full list of features disabled in Restricted Mode, you can open
      the Workspace Trust editor via the <strong>Manage</strong> link in the
      banner, or by clicking the Restricted Mode badge in the Status bar.

    <h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/docs/editor/tasks.md">Tasks</a> can run scripts and tool
      binaries, and because task definitions are defined in the workspace
      <code>.vscode</code> folder, they are part of the committed source code
      for a repo, and shared to every user of that repo. Were someone to create
      a malicious task, it could be unknowningly run by anyone who cloned that
      repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you try to run or even enumerate tasks (<strong>Terminal</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Run Task…</strong>) while in Restricted Mode, VS Code will display
      a prompt to trust the folder and continue executing the task. Cancelling
      the dialog leaves VS Code in Restricted Mode.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Workspace Trust Restricted Mode tasks dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to running a VS Code task, debug extensions can run debugger
      binaries when launching a debug session. For that reason,
      <a href="/docs/editor/debugging.md">debugging</a> is also disabled when a
      folder is open in Restricted Mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you try to start a debug session (<strong>Run</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Start Debugging</strong>) while in Restricted Mode, VS Code will
      display a prompt to trust the folder and continue launching the debugger.
      Cancelling the dialog leaves VS Code in Restricted Mode, and does not
      start the debug session.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h3 id="workspace-settings">Workspace settings</h3>
    <p>
      Workspace <a href="/docs/getstarted/settings.md">settings</a> are stored
      in the <code>.vscode</code> folder at the root of your workspace, and are
      therefore shared by anyone who clones the workspace repository. Some
      settings contain paths to executables (for example, linter binaries),
      which if set to point to malicious code, could do damage. For this reason,
      there is a set of workspace settings that are disabled when running in
      Restricted Mode.
    </p>
    <figure>

    <p>
      In the Workspace Trust editor, there is a link to display the workspace
      settings that aren’t being applied. Clicking the link brings up the
      Settings editor scoped by the
      <code>@tag:requireTrustedWorkspace</code> tag.

    <h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>
    <p>
      The VS Code
      <a href="/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md">extensions</a> ecosystem
      is incredibly rich and diverse. People have created extensions to help
      with just about any programming task or editor customization. Some
      extensions provide full programming language support (IntelliSense,
      debugging, code analysis), and others let you play music or have virtual
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets"
        >pets</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most extensions run code on your behalf and could potentially do harm.
      Some extensions have settings that could cause them to act maliciously if
      configured to run an unexpected executable. For this reason, extensions
      that have not explicitly opted into Workspace Trust are disabled by
      default in Restricted Mode.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/workspace-trust/disabled-extensions-link.png"
        alt="Workspace Trust disabled extensions link"
      />
      <figcaption>Workspace Trust disabled extensions link</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can review an installed extension’s status by clicking the
      <strong>extensions are disabled or have limited functionality</strong>
      link in the Workspace Trust editor, which displays the Extensions view
      scoped with the <code>@workspaceUnsupported</code> filter.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/workspace-trust/workspaceUnsupported-extensions-view.png"
        alt="Extensions view filtered by workspaceUnsupported showing disabled and limited extensions"

        limited extensions
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Disabled in Restricted Mode</strong></p>
    <p>
      Extensions that have either not explicitly indicated that they support
      running in Restricted Mode are shown in the
      <strong>Disabled in Restricted Mode</strong> section. An extension author
      can also indicate that they never want to be enabled in Restricted Mode if
      they determine that their extension could be misused by modifications
      (settings or files) in a workspace.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Limited in Restricted Mode</strong></p>
    <p>
      Extension authors can also evaluate their extensions for possible security
      vulnerabilities and declare that they have
      <strong>limited</strong> support when running in Restricted Mode. This
      mode means the extension may disable some features or functionality to
      prevent a possible exploit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extensions can add custom text to the Extensions view Workspace Trust
      badge explaining the limitation when running in an untrusted folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the VS Code built-in PHP extension limits the use of the
      <code>php.validate.executablePath</code> setting to trusted folders since
      overriding this setting could run a malicious program.
    </p>
    <figure>

      />
      <figcaption>PHP extension limited in Restricted Mode hover</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can override an extension’s Workspace Trust support level using the
      <code>extensions.supportUntrustedWorkspaces</code> setting described in
      the <a href="#enabling-extensions">Enabling extensions</a> section below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you try to install an extension in Restricted Mode, you will be
      prompted to either trust the workspace or just install the extension. If
      the extension doesn’t support Workspace Trust, it will be installed, but
      be disabled or running with limited functionality.

    <h2 id="trusting-a-workspace">Trusting a workspace</h2>
    <p>
      If you trust the authors and maintainers of a project, you can trust the
      project’s folder on your local machine. For example, it is usually safe to
      trust repositories from well-known GitHub organizations such as
      github.com/microsoft or github.com/docker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial Workspace Trust prompt when you open a new folder allows you
      to trust that folder and its subfolders.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/workspace-trust/workspace-trust-dialog.png"
        alt="Trust this folder dialog"
      />
      <figcaption>Trust this folder dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can also bring up the Workspace Editor and quickly toggle a folder’s
      trusted state.
    </p>
    <p>There are several ways to bring up the Workspace Editor dialog.</p>
    <p>When in Restricted Mode:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Restricted Mode banner <strong>Manage</strong> link</li>
      <li>Restricted Mode Status bar item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also at any time use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust</strong> command from the
        Command Palette (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manage Workspace Trust</strong> from the
        <strong>Manage</strong> gear in the Activity bar
      </li>
    </ul>
    <figure>

    <h2 id="selecting-folders">Selecting folders</h2>
    <p>
      When you trust a folder, it is added to the
      <strong>Trusted Folders &amp; Workspaces</strong> list displayed in the
      Workspace Trust editor.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/workspace-trust/trusted-folders-workspaces-list.png"
        alt="Workspace Trust editor Trusted Folders and Workspaces list"
      />
      <figcaption>
        Workspace Trust editor Trusted Folders and Workspaces list
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can manually add, edit, and remove folders from this list and the
      active folder enabling trust is highlighted in bold.
    </p>
    <h3 id="selecting-a-parent-folder">Selecting a parent folder</h3>
    <p>
      When you trust a folder via the Workspace Trust editor, you have the
      option to trust the parent folder. This will apply trust to the parent
      folder and all subfolders.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/workspace-trust/trust-parent-folder.png"
        alt="Workspace Trust button dropdown showing Trust All in Parent Folder"
      />
      <figcaption>
        Workspace Trust button dropdown showing Trust All in Parent Folder
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This can be helpful if you have many folders with trusted content
      co-located under one folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When opening a subfolder under a trusted parent, you won’t see the usual
      <strong>Don’t Trust</strong> button to put you back in Restricted Mode,
      instead there is text mentioning that your folder is trusted due to
      another folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add, modify, and remove a parent folder entry from the
      <strong>Trusted Folders &amp; Workspaces</strong> list.
    </p>
    <h3 id="folder-configurations">Folder configurations</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, you can trust a parent folder and all subfolders will
      be trusted. This allows you to control Workspace Trust via a repository’s
      location on disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you could put all trusted repos under a “TrustedRepos” parent

      “ForEvaluation”. You would trust the “TrustedRepos” folder, and
      selectively trust folders under “ForEvaluation”.
    </p>
    <pre><code>├── TrustedRepos - Clone trusted repositories under this parent folder
└── ForEvaluation - Clone experimental or unfamiliar repositories under this parent folder</code></pre>
    <p>
      You also group and set trust on your repositories by grouping them under
      organization-base parent folders.
    </p>
    <pre><code>├── github/microsoft - Clone a specific organization&#39;s repositories under this parent folder
├── github/{myforks} - Place your forked repositories under this parent folder

      What happens if you want to use Restricted Mode but your favorite
      extension doesn’t support Workspace Trust? This can happen if an
      extension, while useful and functional, isn’t being actively maintained
      and hasn’t declared their Workspace Trust support. To handle this
      scenario, you can override the extension’s trust state with the
      <code>extensions.supportUntrustedWorkspaces</code> setting.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Be careful overriding an extension’s Workspace
        Trust support. It may be that the extension author has a good reason for
        disabling their extension in Restricted Mode. If in doubt, reach out to
        the extension author or review recent changelogs to get more context.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If you open the Settings editor
      (<code>kb(workbench.action.openSettings)</code>) and search for “trust
      extensions”, you can find the
      <strong>Extensions: Support Untrusted Workspaces</strong> setting, which
      has an <strong>Edit in settings.json</strong> link.

    </figure>
    <p>
      Select that link and you will go to your user
      <code>settings.json</code> file with a new entry for
      <code>extensions.supportUntrustedWorkspaces</code>. This setting takes an
      object that has a list of extension IDs and their support status and
      version. You can select any of your installed extensions via IntelliSense
      suggestions.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can either enable or disable Workspace Trust support with the
      <code>supported</code> attribute. The <code>version</code> attribute
      specifies the exact extension version applicable and you can remove the
      version field if you want to set the state for all versions.

    <h2 id="opening-untrusted-files">Opening untrusted files</h2>
    <p>
      If you open a file that is located outside of a trusted folder, VS Code
      will detect that the file comes from somewhere outside the folder root and
      prompt you with the option to continue to open the file or open the file
      in a new window in Restricted Mode. Opening in Restricted Mode is the
      safest option and you can always reopen the file in your original VS Code
      window once you determine the file is trustworthy.

      <figcaption>Untrusted files dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If you would prefer to not be prompted when opening files from outside
      trusted workspaces, you can set
      <code>security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles</code> to <code>open</code>.
      You can also set <code>security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles</code> to
      <code>newWindow</code> to always create a new window in Restricted Mode.
      Checking the
      <strong>Remember my decision for all workspaces</strong> option in the
      untrusted files dialog applies your choice to the
      <code>security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles</code> user setting.

      When working with
      <a href="/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces.md">multi-root workspaces</a>
      with multiple folders, if you try to add a new folder to a trusted
      multi-root workspace, you will be prompted to decide if you trust the

    <h3 id="empty-windows-no-open-folder">Empty windows (no open folder)</h3>
    <p>
      By default, if you open a new VS Code window (instance) without opening a
      folder or workspace, VS Code runs the window with full trust. All
      installed extensions are enabled and you can use the empty window without
      restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open a file, you will be prompted whether you want to open an
      <a href="#opening-untrusted-files">untrusted file</a> since there is no
      folder to parent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch an empty window to Restricted Mode using the Workspace
      Trust editor (select <strong>Manage Workspace Trust</strong> from the
      <strong>Manage</strong> gear button or the Command Palette) and selecting
      <strong>Don’t Trust</strong>. The empty window will remain in Restricted
      Mode for your current session but will go back to trusted if you restart
      or create a new window.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want all empty windows to be in Restricted Mode, you can set
      <code>security.workspace.trust.emptyWindow</code> to <code>false</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
    <p>Below are the available Workspace Trust settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>security.workspace.trust.enabled</code> - Enable Workspace Trust
        feature. Default is true.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>security.workspace.trust.startupPrompt</code> - Whether to show
        the Workspace Trust dialog on startup. Default is to only show once per
        distinct folder or workspace.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>security.workspace.trust.emptyWindow</code> - Whether to always
        trust an empty window (no open folder). Default is true.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles</code> - Controls how to
        handle loose files in a workspace. Default is to prompt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>extensions.supportUntrustedWorkspaces</code> - Override extension
        Workspace Trust declarations. Either true or false.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>security.workspace.trust.banner</code> - Controls when the
        Restricted Mode banner is displayed. Default is
        <code>untilDismissed</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="command-line-switch">Command-line switch</h2>
    <p>
      You can disable Workspace Trust via the VS Code command line by passing
      <code>--disable-workspace-trust</code>. This switch only affects the
      current session.

      Can I still edit my source code in Restricted Mode?

      Yes, you can still browse and edit source code in Restricted Mode. Some
      language features may be disabled, but text editing is always supported.

    <h3 id="where-did-my-installed-extensions-go">

    <p>
      In Restricted Mode, any extension that doesn’t support Workspace Trust
      will be disabled, and all UI elements such as Activity bar icons and
      commands will not be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can override an extension’s Workspace Trust support level with the
      <code>extensions.supportUntrustedWorkspaces</code> setting but do so with

      Can I disable the Workspace Trust feature?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can but it is not recommended. If you don’t want VS Code to check for
      Workspace Trust when opening a new folder or repository, you can set
      <code>security.workspace.trust.enabled</code> to false. VS Code will then
      behave as it did before the 1.57 release.

    <p>
      Bring up Workspace Trust editor (<strong
        >Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust</strong
      >
      from the Command Palette) and select the
      <strong>Don’t Trust</strong> button. You can also remove the folder from
      the <strong>Trusted Folders &amp; Workspaces</strong> list.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-dont-i-see-the-dont-trust-button">
      Why don’t I see the “Don’t Trust” button?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you don’t see the <strong>Don’t Trust</strong> button in the Workspace
      Trust dialog, the folder’s trust level may be inherited from a parent
      folder. Review the <strong>Trusted Folders &amp; Workspaces</strong> list
      to check if a parent folder has enabled Workspace Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some workflows such as connecting to a

      <a href="/docs/remote/attach-container.md"
        >attaching to a running Docker container</a

      you should already have a high level of trust.

    <h3 id="what-does-workspace-trust-protect-against">
      What does Workspace Trust protect against?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many features of VS Code allow third-party tools and extensions to run
      automatically, such as linting or format on save, or when you do certain
      operations like compiling code or debugging. An unethical person could
      craft an innocent looking project that would run malicious code without
      your knowledge and harm your local machine. Workspace Trust provides an
      extra layer of security by trying to prevent code execution while you are
      evaluating the safety and integrity of unfamiliar source code.
