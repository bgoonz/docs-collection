    <p>
      Settings Sync lets you share your Visual Studio Code configurations such
      as settings, keybindings, and installed extensions across your machines so
      you are always working with your favorite setup.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Settings Sync is still in preview.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="turning-on-settings-sync">Turning on Settings Sync</h2>
    <p>
      You can turn on Settings Sync using the
      <strong>Turn On Settings Sync…</strong> entry in the
      <strong>Manage</strong> gear menu at the bottom of the Activity Bar.
    </p>

      />
      <figcaption>Turn on Sync command</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You will be asked to sign in and what preferences you would like to sync;
      currently Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Extensions, User Snippets, and UI
      State are supported.
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Selecting the <strong>Sign in &amp; Turn on</strong> button will ask you
      to choose between signing in with your Microsoft or GitHub account.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img

      />
      <figcaption>Settings Sync configure dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      After making this selection, the browser will open so that you can sign in
      to your Microsoft or GitHub account. When a Microsoft account is chosen,
      you can use either personal accounts, such as Outlook accounts, or Azure
      accounts, and you can also link a GitHub account to a new or existing
      Microsoft account.
    </p>
    <p>
      After signing in, Settings Sync will be turned on and continue to
      synchronize your preferences automatically in the background.
    </p>
    <h2 id="merge-or-replace">Merge or Replace</h2>
    <p>
      If you already synced from a machine and turning on sync from another
      machine, you will be shown with following
      <strong>Merge or Replace</strong> dialog.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Merge</strong>: Selecting this option will merge
        <strong>local</strong> settings with <strong>remote</strong> settings
        from the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Replace Local</strong>: Selecting this option will overwrite
        <strong>local</strong> settings with remote settings from the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Merge Manually…</strong>: Selecting this option will open
        <strong>Merges</strong> view where you can merge preferences one by one.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Machine settings (with <code>machine</code> or
      <code>machine-overridable</code>
      <a href="/updates/v1_34.md#machinespecific-settings">scopes</a>) are not
      synchronized by default, since their values are specific to a given
      machine. You can also add or remove settings you want to this list from
      the Settings editor or using the setting
      <code>settingsSync.ignoredSettings</code>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/settings-sync/sync-ignored-settings.png"
        alt="Settings Sync ignored settings"
      />
      <figcaption>Settings Sync ignored settings</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Keyboard Shortcuts are synchronized per platform by default. If your
      keyboard shortcuts are platform-agnostic, you can synchronize them across
      platforms by disabling the setting
      <code>settingsSync.keybindingsPerPlatform</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All built-in and installed extensions are synchronized along with their
      global enablement state. You can skip synchronizing an extension, either
      from the Extensions view (<code>kb(workbench.view.extensions)</code>) or
      using the setting <code>settingsSync.ignoredExtensions</code>.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/settings-sync/sync-ignored-extensions.png"
        alt="Settings Sync ignored settings"

      <figcaption>Settings Sync ignored settings</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Following UI State is synchronized currently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display Language</li>
      <li>Activity Bar entries</li>
      <li>Panel entries</li>
      <li>Views layout and visibility</li>
      <li>Recently used commands</li>
      <li>Do not show again notifications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can always change what is synced via the
      <strong>Settings Sync: Configure</strong> command or by opening the
      <strong>Manage</strong> gear menu, selecting
      <strong>Settings Sync is On</strong>, and then
      <strong>Settings Sync: Configure</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
    <p>
      When synchronizing settings between multiple machines, there may
      occasionally be conflicts. Conflicts can happen when first setting up sync
      between machines or when settings change while a machine is offline. When
      conflicts occur, you will be presented with the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accept Local</strong>: Selecting this option will overwrite
        <strong>remote</strong> settings in the cloud with your local settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accept Remote</strong>: Selecting this option will overwrite
        <strong>local</strong> settings with remote settings from the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Show Conflicts</strong>: Selecting this will display a diff
        editor similar to the Source Control diff editor, where you can preview
        the local and remote settings and choose to either accept local or
        remote or manually resolve the changes in your local settings file and
        then accept the local file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="switching-accounts">Switching Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      If at any time you want to sync your data to a different account, you can
      turn off and turn on Settings Sync again with different account.
    </p>
    <h2 id="syncing-stable-versus-insiders">Syncing Stable versus Insiders</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the VS Code Stable and <a href="/insiders">Insiders</a> builds
      use different Settings Sync services, and therefore do not share settings.
      You can sync your Insiders with Stable by selecting the Stable sync
      service while turning on Settings Sync. This option is only available in
      VS Code Insiders.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/settings-sync/settings-sync-switch.png"
        alt="Settings Sync Switch Service"
      />
      <figcaption>Settings Sync Switch Service</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Since Insiders builds are newer than Stable builds,
      syncing them can sometimes lead to data incompatibility. In such cases,
      Settings sync will be disabled automatically on stable to prevent data
      inconsistencies. Once newer version of Stable build is released, you can
      upgrade your stable client and turn on sync to continue syncing.
    </p>
    <h2 id="restoring-data">Restoring data</h2>
    <p>
      VS Code always stores local and remote backups of your preferences while
      syncing and provides views for accessing these. In case something goes
      wrong, you can restore your data from these views.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/settings-sync/sync-backup-views.png"
        alt="Settings Sync backup views"
      />
      <figcaption>Settings Sync backup views</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can open these views using
      <strong>Settings Sync: Show Synced Data</strong> command from the Command
      Palette. The Local Sync activity view is hidden by default and you can
      enable it using <strong>Views</strong> submenu under
      <strong>Settings Sync</strong> view overflow actions.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/settings-sync/sync-enable-local-activity-view.png"
        alt="Settings Sync enable local backup views"
      />
      <figcaption>Settings Sync enable local backup views</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Local backups folder in the disk can be accessed via the
      <strong>Settings Sync: Open Local Backups Folder</strong> command. The
      folder is organized by the type of preference and contains versions of
      your JSON files, named with a timestamp of when the backup occurred.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Local backups are automatically deleted after 30
        days. For remote backups the latest 20 versions of each individual
        resource (settings, extensions, etc.) is retained.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="synced-machines">Synced Machines</h2>
    <p>
      VS Code keeps track of the machines synchronizing your preferences and
      provides a view to access them. Every machine is given a default name
      based on the type of VS Code (Insiders or Stable) and the platform it is
      on. You can always update the machine name using the edit action available
      on the machine entry in the view. You can also disable sync on another
      machine using <strong>Turn off Settings Sync</strong> context menu action
      on the machine entry in the view.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img

      <figcaption>Settings Sync machines views</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can open this view using
      <strong>Settings Sync: Show Synced Data</strong> command from the Command
      Palette.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reporting-issues">Reporting issues</h2>
    <p>
      Settings Sync activity can be monitored in the
      <strong>Log (Settings Sync)</strong> output view. If you experience a
      problem with Settings Sync, include this log when creating the issue. If
      your problem is related to authentication, also include the log from the
      <strong>Account</strong> output view.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-delete-my-data">How do I delete my data?</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to remove all your data from our servers, just turn off sync
      via <strong>Settings Sync is On</strong> menu available under
      <strong>Manage</strong> gear menu and select the checkbox to clear all
      cloud data. If you choose to re-enable sync, it will be as if you’re
      signing in for the first time.

      What types of accounts can I use for Settings Sync sign in?
    </h3>
    <p>
      VS Code Settings Sync supports signing in with either a Microsoft account
      (for example Outlook or Azure accounts) or a GitHub account. Sign in with
      GitHub Enterprise accounts is not supported. Other authentication
      providers may be supported in the future and you can review the proposed
      Authentication Provider API in
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/88309">issue #88309</a
      >.

    <h3 id="can-i-use-a-different-backend-or-service-for-settings-sync">
      Can I use a different backend or service for Settings Sync?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Settings Sync uses a dedicated service to store settings and coordinate
      updates. A service provider API may be exposed in the future to allow for
      custom Settings Sync backends.
    </p>
    <h2 id="troubleshooting-keychain-issues">
      Troubleshooting keychain issues
    </h2>
    <p>
      Settings Sync persists authentication information to the system keychain.
      Writing to the keychain can fail in some cases if the keychain is
      misconfigured.
    </p>
    <h3 id="macos">macOS</h3>
    <p>
      If the keychain throws the error “The user name or passphrase you entered
      is not correct.”, open the Keychain Access app, right-click on the
      <code>login</code> keychain, and lock and unlock it again. This error was
      first reported in
      <a href="https://github.com/atom/node-keytar/issues/76">issue #76</a> as a
      problem after upgrading to macOS High Sierra, but it has also been
      reported on more recent macOS versions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
    <p>
      If the keychain throws the error “No such
      interface”org.freedesktop.Secret.Collection" on object at path
      /org/freedesktop/secrets/collection/login", try following the steps
      described in
      <a

      to create a new keyring.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the error is “Writing login information to the keychain failed with
      error ‘Unknown or unsupported transport “disabled” for address
      “disabled:”’”, check that <code>dbus-launch</code> has been started by
      following the instructions in

    <h2 id="can-i-share-settings-between-vs-code-stable-and-insiders">
      Can I share settings between VS Code Stable and Insiders?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Please refer to the
      <a href="#syncing-stable-versus-insiders"
        >Syncing Stable versus Insiders</a
      >
      section for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this can sometimes lead to data incompatibility because
      Insiders builds are newer than Stable builds. In such cases, Settings Sync
      will be disabled automatically on Stable to prevent data inconsistencies.
      Once a newer version of the Stable build is released, you can upgrade your
      client and turn on Settings Sync to continue syncing.
