      Why did we build Visual Studio Code?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with
      powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and
      debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
      First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The
      delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling
      with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.
    </p>
    <h2 id="available-for-macos-linux-and-windows">
      Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows
    </h2>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code supports macOS, Linux, and Windows - so you can hit the
      ground running, no matter the platform.

      Edit, build, and debug with ease
    </h2>
    <p>
      At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code
      editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of
      languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax
      highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets,
      and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and
      community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your
      code with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      For serious coding, you’ll often benefit from tools with more code
      understanding than just blocks of text. Visual Studio Code includes
      built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code
      understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the coding gets tough, the tough get debugging. Debugging is
      often the one feature that developers miss most in a leaner coding
      experience, so we made it happen. Visual Studio Code includes an
      interactive debugger, so you can step through source code, inspect
      variables, view call stacks, and execute commands in the console.
    </p>
    <p>
      VS Code also integrates with build and scripting tools to perform common
      tasks making everyday workflows faster. VS Code has support for Git so you
      can work with source control without leaving the editor including viewing
      pending changes diffs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="make-it-your-own">Make it your own</h2>
    <p>
      Customize every feature to your liking and install any number of
      third-party extensions. While most scenarios work “out of the box” with no
      configuration, VS Code also grows with you, and we encourage you to
      optimize your experience to suit your unique needs. VS Code is an
      open-source project so you can also contribute to the growing and vibrant
      community on GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="built-with-love-for-the-web">Built with love for the Web</h2>
    <p>
      VS Code includes enriched built-in support for Node.js development with
      JavaScript and TypeScript, powered by the same underlying technologies
      that drive Visual Studio. VS Code also includes great tooling for web
      technologies such as JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.
    </p>
    <h2 id="robust-and-extensible-architecture">
      Robust and extensible architecture
    </h2>
    <p>
      Architecturally, Visual Studio Code combines the best of web, native, and
      language-specific technologies. Using
      <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">Electron</a>, VS Code
      combines web technologies such as JavaScript and Node.js with the speed
      and flexibility of native apps. VS Code uses a newer, faster version of
      the same industrial-strength HTML-based editor that has powered the
      “Monaco” cloud editor, Internet Explorer’s F12 Tools, and other projects.
      Additionally, VS Code uses a tools service architecture that enables it to
      integrate with many of the same technologies that power Visual Studio,
      including Roslyn for .NET, TypeScript, the Visual Studio debugging engine,
      and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code includes a public extensibility model that lets
      developers build and use extensions, and richly customize their
      edit-build-debug experience.

      If you prefer a code editor-centric development tool or are building
      cross-platform web and cloud applications, we invite you to try out Visual
      Studio Code and let us know what you think!
