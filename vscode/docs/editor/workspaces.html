    <h1 id="what-is-a-vs-code-workspace">What is a VS Code “workspace”?</h1>
    <p>
      A Visual Studio Code “workspace” is the collection of one or more folders
      that are opened in a VS Code window (instance). In most cases, you will
      have a single folder opened as the workspace but, depending on your
      development workflow, you can include more than one folder, using an
      advanced configuration called
      <a href="#multiroot-workspaces">Multi-root workspaces</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Configure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but
        not others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Persist <a href="/docs/editor/tasks.md">task</a> and
        <a href="/docs/editor/debugging.md">debugger launch</a> configurations
        that are only valid in the context of that workspace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example,
        the files that are opened).
      </li>
      <li>Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may see the terms “folder” and “workspace” used interchangeably in VS
      Code documentation, issues, and community discussions. Think of a
      workspace as the root of a project that has extra VS Code knowledge and
      capabilities.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> It is also possible to open VS Code without a
        workspace. For example, when you open a new VS Code window by selecting
        a file from your platform’s <strong>File</strong> menu, you will not be
        inside a workspace. In this mode, some of VS Code’s capabilities are
        reduced but you can still open text files and edit them.

      How do I open a VS Code “workspace”?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to open a workspace is using the
      <strong>File</strong> menu and selecting one of the available folder
      entries for opening. Alternatively if you launch VS Code from a terminal,
      you can pass the path to a folder as the first argument to the
      <code>code</code> command for opening.
    </p>
    <h2 id="single-folder-workspaces">Single-folder workspaces</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t have to do anything for a folder to become a VS Code workspace
      other than open the folder with VS Code. Once a folder has been opened, VS
      Code will automatically keep track of things such as your open files and
      editor layout so the editor will be as you left it when you reopen that
      folder. You can also add other folder-specific configurations such as
      workspace-specific
      <a href="/docs/getstarted/settings.md">settings</a> (versus global user
      settings), <a href="/docs/editor/tasks.md">task definitions</a>, and
      <a href="/docs/editor/debugging.md">debugging launch</a> files (see below
      in the <a href="#workspace-settings">workspace settings</a> section).

      <a href="/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces.md">Multi-root workspaces</a>
      are an advanced capability of VS Code that allows you to configure
      multiple distinct folders to be part of the workspace. Instead of opening
      a folder as workspace, you will open a
      <code>&lt;name&gt;.code-workspace</code> JSON file that lists the folders
      of the workspace. For example:
    </p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> The visual difference of having a folder opened
        versus opening a <code>.code-workspace</code> file can be subtle. To
        give you a hint that a <code>.code-workspace</code> file has been
        opened, some areas of the user interface (for example, the root of the
        File Explorer) show an extra <strong>(Workspace)</strong> suffix next to
        the name.

    <p>
      It is easy to add or remove folders in your workspace. You can start off
      by opening a folder in VS Code and then later add more folders as you see
      fit. Unless you already have opened a <code>.code-workspace</code> file,
      the first time you add a second folder to a workspace, VS Code will
      automatically create an “untitled” workspace. In the background, VS Code
      automatically maintains a <code>untitled.code-workspace</code> file for
      you that contains all of the folders and workspace settings from your
      current session. The workspace will remain “untitled” until you decide to
      save it to disk.

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> There is really no difference between an untitled
        workspace and a saved workspace other than the fact that an untitled
        workspace is automatically created for you for your convenience and will
        always restore until you save it. We automatically delete untitled
        workspaces (after asking you for confirmation) when you close a window
        in which an untitled workspace is opened.

    <h2 id="workspace-settings">Workspace settings</h2>
    <p>
      Workspace settings enable you to configure settings in the context of the
      workspace you have opened and always override global user settings. They
      are physically stored in a JSON file and their location depends on whether
      you opened a folder as a workspace or you opened a
      <code>.code-workspace</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="/docs/getstarted/settings.md">settings</a> documentation for a

      Workspace tasks and launch configurations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Similar to how <a href="#workspace-settings">workspace settings</a> are
      specific to a workspace, tasks and launch configurations can also be
      scoped to a workspace. Depending on whether you have a folder opened as
      workspace or a <code>.code-workspace</code> file, the location of
      workspace task and launch configurations will either be inside the
      <code>.vscode</code> folder or inside the
      <code>.code-workspace</code> file. In addition, task and launch
      configurations can always be defined at the level of a folder, even when
      you have opened a <code>.code-workspace</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refer to <a href="/docs/editor/tasks.md">tasks</a> and
      <a href="/docs/editor/debugging.md">debugging</a> chapters for a more
      comprehensive overview of how to use tasks and launch configurations in VS
      Code.

    <h3 id="what-is-the-benefit-of-multi-root-workspace-over-a-folder">
      What is the benefit of multi-root workspace over a folder?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most obvious advantage is that a multi-root workspace allows you to
      work with multiple projects that may not be stored inside the same parent
      folder on disk. You can pick folders from anywhere to add to the
      workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you are mainly working in a single-folder-based project, you can
      benefit from using <code>.code-workspace</code> files. You can store
      multiple <code>.code-workspace</code> files inside the folder to provide a
      scoped folder-view of certain aspects of the project depending on the
      scenario (for example <code>client.code-workspace</code>,
      <code>server.code-workspace</code> to filter out unrelated folders from
      the File Explorer). Since <code>.code-workspace</code> files support
      relative paths for the <code>folders</code> section, these workspace files
      will work for everyone independent of where the folder is stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if for some projects you want to apply the same set of workspace
      settings or tasks/launch configurations, consider adding these into a
      <code>.code-workspace</code> file and add/remove these folders from that
      workspace.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-is-vs-code-restoring-all-untitled-workspaces-on-a-restart">
      Why is VS Code restoring all untitled workspaces on a restart?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Untitled workspaces are designed to be something you must explicitly
      decide to keep or not. The first time an untitled workspace is created, VS
      Code adds the specified folders into the workspace file and also all
      existing workspace settings. This user data is always restored and
      displayed in a VS Code window until the untitled workspace is saved or
      deleted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-do-i-delete-an-untitled-workspace">
      How do I delete an untitled workspace?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can delete an untitled workspace by closing its window and dismissing
      the prompt to save the untitled workspace.
    </p>
    <h3 id="can-i-use-a-multi-root-workspace-without-folders">
      Can I use a multi-root workspace without folders
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is possible to leave the <code>folders</code> section of a
      <code>.code-workspace</code> file empty so that you end up with an
      instance of VS Code that does not show any root folders. You can still
      store workspace settings and even tasks or launch configurations in this
      case.
    </p>
    <h3 id="does-vs-code-support-projects-or-solutions">
      Does VS Code support projects or solutions?
    </h3>
    <p>
      VS Code doesn’t have the concept of a “project” or “solution” as they are
      sometimes defined in other development tools, for example Visual Studio
      IDE. You may see the term “project” used in VS Code documentation but it
      usually means “the thing you’re working on”. Depending on your programming
      language or framework, the toolset itself may support something called a
      “project” to help define build configurations or enumerate included files.
