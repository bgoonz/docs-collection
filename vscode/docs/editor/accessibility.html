<h1 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h1>
<p>Visual Studio Code has many features to help make the editor accessible to all users. Zoom and High Contrast colors improve editor visibility, keyboard-only navigation allows use without a mouse, and the editor has been optimized for screen readers.</p>
<h2 id="zoom">Zoom</h2>
<p>You can adjust the Zoom level in VS Code with the <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom</strong> commands. The zoom level increases or decreases by 20% each time a <strong>Zoom</strong> command is executed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom In</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.zoomIn)</code>) - increase the Zoom level.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom Out</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.zoomOut)</code>) - decrease the Zoom level.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset Zoom</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.zoomReset)</code>) - reset the Zoom level to 0.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="persisted-zoom-level">Persisted Zoom Level</h3>
<p>When you adjust the zoom level with the <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom In / Out</strong> commands, the zoom level is persisted in the <code>window.zoomLevel</code> <a href="/docs/getstarted/settings.md">setting</a>. The default value is 0 and each increment/decrement changes the zoom level by 20%.</p>
<h2 id="high-contrast-theme">High Contrast theme</h2>
<p>We support a High Contrast color theme on all platforms. Use <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Color Theme</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.selectTheme)</code>) to display the <strong>Select Color Theme</strong> dropdown and select the <strong>High Contrast</strong> theme.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="keyboard-navigation">Keyboard navigation</h2>
<p>You will find that VS Code provides an exhaustive list of commands in the <strong>Command Palette</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>) so that you can run VS Code without using the mouse. Press <code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code> then type a command name (for example ‘git’) to filter the list of commands.</p>
<p>VS Code also has many preset keyboard shortcuts for commands. These are displayed to the right of the command in the <strong>Command Palette</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts.png" alt="Keyboard shortcuts in Command Palette" /><figcaption>Keyboard shortcuts in Command Palette</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also set your own keyboard shortcuts. <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings)</code>) brings up the Keyboard Shortcuts editor where you can discover and modify keybindings for VS Code actions. See <a href="/docs/getstarted/keybindings.md">Key Bindings</a> for more details on customizing or adding your own keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>For a quick navigation across the workbench, we recommend using <strong>Focus Next Part</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)</code>) and <strong>Focus Previous Part</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.focusPreviousPart)</code>) commands.</p>
<h3 id="anchor-selection">Anchor selection</h3>
<p>To make it easier to start and end selection using the keyboard we have four commands: <strong>Set Selection Anchor</strong> (<code>kb(editor.action.setSelectionAnchor)</code>), <strong>Select From Anchor to Cursor</strong> (<code>kb(editor.action.selectFromAnchorToCursor)</code>), <strong>Cancel Selection Anchor</strong> (<code>kb(editor.action.cancelSelectionAnchor)</code>) and <strong>Go to Selection Anchor</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="tab-navigation">Tab navigation</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> key to jump between VS Code UI controls. Use <code>kbstyle(Shift+Tab)</code> to tab in reverse order. As you tab through the UI controls, you can see an indicator around the UI element once the element gains focus.</p>
<p>All elements in the workbench support tab navigation, but workbench toolbars and tab lists have only one tab stop, to avoid having too many. Once the focus is on a toolbar or a tab list, you can use the arrow keys to navigate within them.</p>
<h2 id="tab-trapping">Tab trapping</h2>
<p>By default, pressing the <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> within a source code file inserts the Tab character (or spaces depending on your Indentation setting) and does not leave the open file. You can toggle the trapping of <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> with <code>kb(editor.action.toggleTabFocusMode)</code> and subsequent <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> keys will move focus out of the file. When default <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> trapping is off, you will see an indicator in the Status Bar.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/accessibility/tab-moves-focus.png" alt="tab moves focus" /><figcaption>tab moves focus</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also toggle <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> trapping from the <strong>Command Palette</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>) with the <strong>Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus</strong> action.</p>
<p>Read-only files never trap the <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> key. The <strong>Integrated Terminal</strong> panel respects the <code>kbstyle(Tab)</code> trapping mode and can be toggled with <code>kb(editor.action.toggleTabFocusMode)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="screen-readers">Screen readers</h2>
<p>VS Code supports screen readers in the editor using a strategy based on paging the text. We have tested using the following screen readers: <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a> and JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS and Orca on Linux.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For NVDA, we recommend staying in focus mode and using the hotkeys to navigate, instead of using browse mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Go to Next/Previous Error or Warning</strong> actions (<code>kb(editor.action.marker.nextInFiles)</code> and <code>kb(editor.action.marker.prevInFiles)</code>) allow screen readers to announce the error or warning messages.</p>
<p>When the suggestions pop up, they will get announced to screen readers. It is possible to navigate the suggestions using <code>kbstyle(Ctrl+Up)</code> and <code>kbstyle(Ctrl+Down)</code>, you can dismiss the suggestions with <code>kbstyle(Shift+Escape)</code> and if suggestions get in your way, you can disable the auto-popup of suggestions with the <code>editor.quickSuggestions</code> setting.</p>
<p>The <strong>Go to Next/Previous Difference</strong> actions (<code>kb(editor.action.diffReview.next)</code> and <code>kb(editor.action.diffReview.prev)</code>), when in a diff editor pane, will bring up the Diff Review pane, which allows the navigation of the diffs, presented in a unified patch format. Arrow Up and Arrow Down can be used to navigate through the unchanged, inserted, or deleted lines. Pressing <code>kbstyle(Enter)</code> will return focus to the modified pane of the diff editor at the selected line number (or closest still existing line number in case a deleted line is selected). Use <code>kbstyle(Escape)</code> or <code>kb(Shift+Escape)</code> to dismiss the Diff Review pane.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-help">Accessibility help</h2>
<p>You can press <code>kb(editor.action.showAccessibilityHelp)</code> to trigger the <strong>Show Accessibility Help</strong> dialog while in an editor to check the state of various accessibility options in VS Code:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/accessibility/status.png" alt="accessibility status" /><figcaption>accessibility status</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="screen-reader-mode">Screen reader mode</h2>
<p>When VS Code detects that a screen reader is being used, it goes into screen reader optimized mode for the UI such as the editor and Integrated Terminal. The Status Bar displays <strong>Screen Reader Optimized</strong> in the lower right and you can exit screen reader mode by clicking on the display text.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/accessibility/screen-reader-mode.png" alt="screen reader optimized mode" /><figcaption>screen reader optimized mode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain features such as folding, minimap (code overview), and word wrap are disabled when in screen reader mode. You can control whether VS Code uses screen reader mode with the <strong>Editor: Accessibility Support</strong> setting (<code>editor.accessibilitySupport</code>) and the values are <code>on</code>, <code>off</code>, or the default <code>auto</code> to automatically detect a screen reader through querying the platform.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-accessibility">Terminal accessibility</h2>
<p>Output in the Integrated Terminal can be navigated through by using the “navigation mode” commands available in the Command Palette (press <code>kbstyle(F1)</code> and search for “terminal navigation mode”).</p>
<h3 id="minimum-contrast-ratio">Minimum contrast ratio</h3>
<p>The setting <code>terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio</code> can be set to a number between 1 and 21, this will cause the text color either increase or reduce luminance until the contrast ratio is met or pure white (<code>#FFFFFF</code>) black (<code>#000000</code>) is hit.</p>
<h2 id="status-bar-accessibility">Status Bar accessibility</h2>
<p>Once a focus is in the Status bar via <strong>Focus Next Part</strong> (<code>kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)</code>) arrow navigation can be used to move focus between Status bar entries.</p>
<h2 id="debugger-accessibility">Debugger accessibility</h2>
<p>The VS Code debugger UI is user accessible and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in debug state are read out (for example ‘started’, ‘breakpoint hit’, ‘terminated’, …).</li>
<li>All debug actions are keyboard accessible.</li>
<li>Both the Run view and Debug Console support Tab navigation.</li>
<li>Debug hover is keyboard accessible (<code>kb(editor.action.showHover)</code>).</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts can be created to set focus to each debugger area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="current-known-issues">Current known issues</h2>
<p>VS Code has some known accessibility issues depending on the platform. Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility">full list</a> of VS Code accessibility issues.</p>
<h3 id="macos">macOS</h3>
<p>There is screen reader support for the editor with VoiceOver.</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>Screen reader support for the editor is still work in progress because the accessibility implementation for Chrome on Linux is work in progress. Thus there are a couple of things needed in order to have screen reader Orca working with VS Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to use the latest version of Orca out of master. More details can be found on the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca/-/blob/master/README.md">Orca page</a>.</li>
<li>We have tested that VS Code works well with Orca on Ubuntu 18, Fedora 31, Arch Linux. With Ubuntu 19, we have encountered issues.</li>
<li>Make sure to have the setting <code>"editor.accessibilitySupport": "on"</code> in VS Code. You can do this using settings, or by running the <strong>Show Accessibility Help</strong> command and pressing <code>kbstyle(Ctrl+E)</code> to turn on accessibilitySupport.</li>
<li>If Orca is still silent, try setting <code>ACCESSIBILITY_ENABLED=1</code> as an environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>After enabling that setting, VS Code should work with the Orca screen reader.</p>
