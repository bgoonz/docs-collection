# Create Docker containers for Python

This tutorial walks you through the full process of containerizing an existing Python application using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and pushing the app image to a Docker registry, all within Visual Studio Code. The tutorial also demonstrates how to use base container images that include production-ready web servers (uwsgi and nginx), and how to configure those servers for both [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) web apps, which is helpful to know no matter what your deployment target.

If you have any problems, feel free to file an issue for this tutorial in the [VS Code documentation repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues).

## An introduction to containers

Docker is a system that allows you to deploy and run apps using **containers** rather than setting up dedicated environments like virtual machines. A container is a lightweight runtime environment that shares the resources of the host operating system with other containers. Docker is the layer that sits above the operating system to manage resources on behalf of containers.

A container is specifically an instance of a Docker **image**, an executable package that contains everything needed to run your app: app code, configuration files, runtimes, and all of app’s dependencies. An image can be used to instantiate any number of identical containers, which is especially useful when scaling out a cloud-based web app. Because container images are much smaller than virtual machine images, instances can be started and stopped much more quickly than virtual machines, enabling your app to be highly responsive to varying loads at a minimal cost. (When used to scale web apps, containers are often managed in **clusters**, which are then managed by an orchestration agent such as [Kubernetes](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes).)

Images, for their part, are built in multiple **layers**. The lowest or **base** layers of an image are typically common elements like the Python runtime; the higher layers contain more specialized elements like your application code. Because of layering, it takes very little time to rebuild an image when changing only the top layer with your app code. Similarly, when you push an image to a **container registry**, an online repository for images from which you can deploy to cloud services like Azure, only the modified layers need be uploaded and redeployed. As a result, using containers has only a small impact on your develop-test-deploy loop.

You experience the basics of containers and images in the course of this tutorial. For additional background, including helpful diagrams, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Python and the Python extension as described on [Python Tutorial - Prerequisites](/docs/python/python-tutorial.md).
- [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition). To verify your installation, run the command `docker --version`, which should show output like `Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a`.
- The [Docker extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker), which helps you manage local Docker images, provides Docker commands, and simplifies deployment of app images to Azure. You can find an overview of the extension on the [vscode-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker)
- Suitable [app code](#app-code)

### App code

If you don’t already have an app you’d like to work with, use one of the following samples, which already include the Docker-related files described in this tutorial:

- [python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial), which is the result of following the [Django Tutorial](/docs/python/tutorial-django.md).

- [python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial), which is the result of following the [Flask Tutorial](/docs/python/tutorial-flask.md).

After verifying that your app runs properly, generate a `requirements.txt` file (using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, for example) so that those dependencies can be automatically installed in the Docker image. The samples each include a `requirements.txt` file.

## Create a container registry

As mentioned earlier, a container registry is an online repository for container images that allows a cloud service, like Azure App Service, to acquire the image whenever it needs to start a container instance. Because the registry manages images separate from container instances, the same image in a registry can be used to start any number of concurrent instances, as happens when scaling out a web app to handle increased loads.

Because setting up a registry is a one-time affair, you do that step now before creating images that you then push to that registry.

Registry options include the following:

- The [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/), a private, secure, hosted registry for your images.
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), Docker’s own hosted registry that provides a free way to share images.
- A private registry running on your own server, as described on [Docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) in the Docker documentation.

To create an Azure Container Registry, as shown later in this tutorial, do the following:

1.  Follow the first part of [Quickstart: Create a container registry using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal) through the “Log in to ACR” section. You don’t need to complete the sections “Push image to ACR” and later because you do those steps within VS Code as part of this tutorial.

2.  Make sure that the registry endpoint you created is visible under **Registries** in the **Docker** explorer of VS Code:

    ![Docker explorer in VS Code showing registries](images/create-containers/registries.png)

## Create a container image

A container image is a bundle of your app code and its dependencies. To create an image, Docker needs a `Dockerfile` that describes how to structure the app code in the container and how to get that code running. The `Dockerfile`, in other words, is the template for your image. The Docker extension helps you create these files with customization for production servers.

> **Note**: The Python samples linked earlier in this article already contain the necessary Docker files. The instructions here help you create files for an app of your own.

## Create the Docker files

1.  In VS Code, open the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and select the **Docker: Add Docker files to workspace** command.

2.  When the prompt appears after a few moments, select **Python** as the app type.

3.  Specify the port on which your app listens, such as 8000 (as in the Django sample) or 5000 (as in the Flask sample). The port value ends up only in the Docker compose files (see below) and have no impact on your container image.

4.  With all this information, the Docker extension creates the following files:

    - The `Dockerfile` file describes the contents of your app’s layer in the image. Your app layer is added on top of the base image indicated in the `Dockerfile`.. By default, the name of the image is the name of the workspace folder in VS Code.

    - A `.dockerignore` file that reduces image size by excluding files and folders that aren’t needed in the image, such as `.git` and `.vscode`. For Python, add another line to the file for `__pycache__`.

    - `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.debug.yml` files that are used with [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/). For the purposes of this tutorial, you can ignore or delete these files.

> **Tip:** VS Code provides great support for Docker files. See the [Working with Docker](/docs/azure/docker.md) article to learn about rich language features like smart suggestions, completions, and error detection.

## Using production servers

For Python, the Docker extension by default specifies the base image `python:alpine` in the `Dockerfile` and includes commands to run only the Flask development server. These defaults obviously don’t accommodate Django, for one, and when deploying to the cloud, as with Azure App Service, you should also use production-ready web servers instead of a development server. (If you’ve used Flask, you’re probably accustomed to seeing the development server’s warning in this regard!)

For this reason, you need to modify the `Dockerfile` to use a base image with production servers, then provide the necessary configuration for your app. The following sections provide details for both Flask and Django.

### Changes for Flask apps

A good base image for Flask is `tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.6-alpine3.7`, which is also available for other versions of Python (see the [tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask repository](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker) on GitHub). This image already contains Flask and the production-ready uwsgi and nginx servers.

By default, the image assumes that (a) your app code is located in an `app` folder, (b) the Flask app object is named `app`, and (c) the app object is located in `main.py`. Because your app may have a different structure, you can indicate the correct folders in the Dockerfile and provide the necessary parameters the uwsgi server in a `uwsgi.ini` file.

The following steps summarize the configuration used in the [python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial) app, which you can adapt for your own code.

1.  The `Dockerfile` indicates the location and name of the Flask app object, the location of static files for nginx, and the location of the `uwsgi.ini` file. (The `Dockerfile` in the sample contains further explanatory comments that are omitted here.)

        FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.6-alpine3.7

        ENV LISTEN_PORT=5000
        EXPOSE 5000

        # Indicate where uwsgi.ini lives
        ENV UWSGI_INI=uwsgi.ini

        # Tell nginx where static files live.
        ENV STATIC_URL=/hello_app/static

        # Set the folder where uwsgi looks for the app
        WORKDIR /hello_app

        # Copy the app contents to the image
        COPY . /hello_app

        # If you have additional requirements beyond Flask (which is included in the
        # base image), generate a requirements.txt file with pip freeze and uncomment
        # the next three lines.
        #COPY requirements.txt /
        #RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -U pip
        #RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /requirements.txt

2.  The `uwsgi.ini` file, which is in the root of the sample project folder, provides configuration arguments for the uwsgi server. For the sample, the configuration below says that the Flask app object is found in the `hello_app/webapp.py` module, and that it’s named (that is, “callable” as) `app`. The other values are additional common uwsgi settings:

        [uwsgi]
        module = hello_app.webapp
        callable = app
        uid = 1000
        master = true
        threads = 2
        processes = 4

### Changes for Django apps

A good base image for Django is `tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx:python3.6-alpine3.7`, which is also available for other versions of Python (see the [tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx repository](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-docker) on GitHub).

This base image already contains the production-ready uwsgi and nginx servers, but does not include Django. It’s also necessary to provide settings to uwsgi so it can find the app’s startup code.

The following steps summarize the configuration used in the [python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial) app that you can adapt for your own code.

1.  Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project that contains Django and its dependencies. You can generate `requirements.txt` using the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2.  In your Django project’s `settings.py` file, modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list to include the root URL to which you intend to deploy the app. For example, the following code assumes deployment to an Azure App Service (azurewebsites.net) named “vsdocs-django-sample-container”:

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
            # Example host name only; customize to your specific host
            "vsdocs-django-sample-container.azurewebsites.net"
        ]

    Without this entry, you’ll eventually get all the way through the deployment only to see a “DisallowedHost” message that instructs to you add the domain to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, which requires that you rebuild, push, and redeploy the image all over again!

3.  Create a `uwsgi.ini` file in the Django project folder (alongside `manage.py`) that contains startup arguments for the uwsgi server. In the sample, the Django project is in a folder called `web_project`, which is where the `wsgi.py` and `setting.py` files live.

        [uwsgi]
        chdir = .
        module = web_project.wsgi:application
        env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=web_project.settings
        uid = 1000
        master = true
        threads = 2
        processes = 4

4.  To serve static files, copy the _nginx.conf_ file from the [django-react-devcontainer repo](https://github.com/qubitron/django-react-devcontainer/blob/master/nginx.conf) into your Django project folder.

5.  Modify the `Dockerfile` to indicate the location of `uwsgi.ini`, set the location of static files for nginx, and make sure the SQLite database file is writable. (The `Dockerfile` in the sample contains further explanatory comments that are omitted here.)

        FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx:python3.6-alpine3.7

        ENV LISTEN_PORT=8000
        EXPOSE 8000

        # Indicate where uwsgi.ini lives
        ENV UWSGI_INI=uwsgi.ini

        # Tell nginx where static files live (as typically collected using Django's
        # collectstatic command.
        ENV STATIC_URL=/app/static_collected

        # Copy the app files to a folder and run it from there
        WORKDIR /app
        ADD . /app

        # Make app folder writable for the sake of db.sqlite3, and make that file also writable.
        RUN chmod g+w /app
        RUN chmod g+w /app/db.sqlite3

        # Make sure dependencies are installed
        RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

> **Note**: When building a Docker image on Windows, you typically see the message below, which is why the Dockerfile shown here includes the two `chmod` commands. If need to make other files writable, add the appropriate `chmod` commands to your Dockerfile.
>
>     SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. All files and directories added to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive files and directories.

## Build and test the image

With the necessary `Dockerfile` in place, you’re ready to build the Docker image and run it locally:

1.  Make sure that Docker is running on your computer.

2.  On the VS Code **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), select **Docker: Build Image**.

3.  When prompted for the Docker file, choose the `Dockerfile` that you created in the previous section. (VS Code remembers your selection so you won’t need to enter it again to rebuild.)

4.  When prompted for a name to give the image, use a name that follows the conventional form of `<registry or username>/<image name>:<tag>`, where `<tag>` is typically `latest`. Here are some examples (when using the Azure Container Registry):

        # Examples for Azure Container Registry, prefixed with the registry name
        vsdocsregistry.azurecr.io/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial:latest
        vsdocsregistry.azurecr.io/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial:latest
        vsdocsregistry.azurecr.io/myexpressapp:latest

        # Examples for Docker hub, prefixed with your username
        vsdocs-team/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial:latest
        vsdocs-team/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial:latest
        vsdocs-team/myexpressapp:latest

5.  Each step of Docker’s build process appears in the VS Code Terminal panel, including any errors that occur running the steps in the `Dockerfile`.

    > **Tip**: every time you run the **Docker: Build image** command, the Docker extension opens another Terminal in VS Code in which to run the command. You can close each terminal once the build is complete. Alternately, you can reuse the same terminal to build the image by scrolling up in the command history using the up arrow.

6.  When the build is complete, the image appears in the **Docker** explorer under **Images**:

    ![Docker Image](images/create-containers/image-list.png)

7.  Run and test your container locally by using the following command, replacing `<image_name>` with your specific image, and changing the port numbers as needed. For web apps, you can then open browser to `localhost:<port>` to see the running app.

        # For Flask sample
        docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 <image_name>

        # For Django sample
        docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 <image_name>

### Two useful features of the Docker extension

The Docker extension provides a simple UI to manage and even run your images rather than using the Docker CLI. Just expand the **Image** node in the Docker explorer, right-click any image, and select any of the menu items:

![Managing images with the Docker extension](images/create-containers/manage-images.png)

In addition, on the top of the Docker explorer, next to the refresh button, is a button for **System Prune**. This command cleans up any dangling and otherwise unused images on your local computer. It’s a good idea to periodically use the command to reclaim space on your file system.

![System Prune command in the Docker explorer](images/create-containers/system-prune-command.png)

## Push the image to a registry

Once you’re confident that your image works, the next step is to push it to your container registry:

1.  On the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), select **Docker: Push**.

2.  Choose the image you just built to push the image to the registry; upload progress appears in the Terminal.

3.  Once completed, expand the **Registries** &gt; **Azure** (or **DockerHub**) node in the **Docker** explorer, then expand the registry and image name to see the exact image. (You may need to refresh the **Docker** explorer.)

    ![The built app image in the Azure Container Registry](images/create-containers/image-in-acr.png)

> **Tip:** The first time you push an image, you see that VS Code uploads all of the different layers that make up the image. Subsequent push operations, however, upload only those layers that have changed. Because it’s typically only your app code that’s changes, those uploads happen much more quickly, making for a tight edit-build-deploy-test loop. To see this, make a small change to your code, rebuild the image, and then push again to the registry. The whole process typically completes in a matter of seconds.

## Next steps

Now that you’ve created a container with your app, you’re ready to deploy it to any container-ready cloud service. For details on deploying to Azure App Service, see [Deploy a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-containers-01).
