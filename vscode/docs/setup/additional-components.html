<h1 id="additional-components-and-tools">Additional components and tools</h1>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a small download by design and only includes the minimum number of components shared across most development workflows. Basic functionality like the editor, file management, window management, and preference settings are included. A JavaScript/TypeScript language service and Node.js debugger are also part of the base install.</p>
<p>If you are used to working with larger, monolithic development tools (IDEs), you may be surprised that your scenarios aren’t completely supported out of the box. For example, there isn’t a <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>New Project</strong> dialog with pre-installed project templates. Most VS Code users will need to install additional components depending on their specific needs.</p>
<h2 id="commonly-used-components">Commonly used components</h2>
<p>Here are a few commonly installed components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Git</a> - VS Code has built-in support for source code control using Git but requires Git to be installed separately.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js (includes npm)</a> - A cross platform runtime for building and running JavaScript applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> - The TypeScript compiler, <code>tsc</code>, for transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find the components above mentioned often in our documentation and walkthroughs.</p>
<h2 id="vs-code-extensions">VS Code extensions</h2>
<p>You can extend the VS Code editor itself through <a href="/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md">extensions</a>. The VS Code community has built hundreds of useful extensions available on the VS Code <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode">Marketplace</a>.</p>

<h2 id="additional-tools">Additional tools</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code integrates with existing tool chains. We think the following tools will enhance your development experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> - An application scaffolding tool, a command line version of <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>New Project</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-aspnet">generator-aspnet</a> - A Yeoman generator for scaffolding <a href="https://asp.net">ASP.NET Core</a> applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel">generator-hottowel</a> - A Yeoman generator for quickly creating AngularJS applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> - An application framework for Node.js applications using the Pug template engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> - A streaming task runner system which integrates easily with VS Code tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> - A JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js.</li>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> - A dependency manager and alternative to npm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Most of these tools require Node.js and the npm package manager to install and use.</p>
