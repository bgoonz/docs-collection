Go in Visual Studio Code
========================

Using the Go extension for Visual Studio Code, you get features like IntelliSense, code navigation, symbol search, testing, debugging, and many more that will help you in [Go](https://golang.org/) development.

You can install the Go extension from the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go).

Watch [“Getting started with VS Code Go”](https://youtu.be/1MXIGYrMk80) for an explanation of how to build your first Go application using VS Code Go.

This article describes only a subset of the features the Go extension provides. See the extension’s [documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md) for the full, up-to-date list of supported features.

IntelliSense
------------

![IntelliSense](images/go/completion-signature-help.gif)

IntelliSense features are provided by the Go language server, [gopls](https://golang.org/s/gopls), maintained by the Go team. You can configure the behavior of `gopls` using the [`gopls` settings](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#settings-for-gopls).

### Auto completions

As you type in a Go file, you can see IntelliSense providing you with suggested completions. This even works for members in current, imported, and not yet imported packages. Just type any package name followed by `.`, and you will get suggestions for the corresponding package members.

> **Tip**: Use `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)` to trigger the suggestions manually.

### Hover Information

Hovering on any variable, function, or struct will give you information on that item such as documentation, signature, etc.

### Signature help

When you open the `(` while calling a function, a pop-up provides signature help for the function. As you keep typing the parameters, the hint (underline) moves to the next parameter.

> **Tip**: Use `kb(editor.action.triggerParameterHints)` to manually trigger the signature help when the cursor is inside the `()` in the function call.

Code navigation
---------------

Code navigation features are available in the context menu in the editor.

-   **Go To Definition** `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)` - Go to the source code of the type definition.
-   **Peek Definition** `kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)` - Bring up a Peek window with the type definition.
-   **Go to References** `kb(editor.action.goToReferences)` - Show all references for the type.
-   **Show Call Hierarchy** `kb(editor.showCallHierarchy)` - Show all calls from or to a function.

You can navigate via symbol search using the **Go to Symbol** commands from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).

-   Go to Symbol in File - `kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`
-   Go to Symbol in Workspace - `kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`

You can also navigate back and forth between a Go file and its test implementation using the **Go: Toggle Test File** command.

Build, test, and diagnose
-------------------------

The Go language server (`gopls`) detects build and vet errors found on the workspace. The errors and warnings from running any/all of the above will be shown red/green squiggly lines in the editor. These diagnostics also show up in the **Problems** panel (**View** &gt; **Problems**).

You can add additional lint checks using the `go.lintOnSave` setting and configuring your choice of linting tool (`staticcheck`, `golangci-lint`, or `revive`) using the `go.lintTool` setting.

You can configure the extension to run tests and compute test coverage using:

-   `go.testOnSave`
-   `go.coverOnSave`
-   `go.testFlags`

Formatting
----------

You can format your Go file using `kb(editor.action.formatDocument)` or by running the **Format Document** command from the **Command Palette** or the context menu in the editor.

By default, formatting is run when you save your Go file. You can disable this behavior by setting `editor.formatOnSave` to `false` for the `[go]` language identifier. You can change this using your JSON setting files.

    "[go]": {
            "editor.formatOnSave": false
    }

When you have multiple formatters activated for Go files, you can select the Go extension as the default formatter.

    "[go]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "golang.go"
    }

Formatting is provided by `gopls`. If you want `gofumpt`-style formatting, you can configure `gopls` to use `gofumpt`.

    "gopls": {
        "formatting.gofumpt": true
    }

Test
----

There are many test-related commands that you can explore by typing **Go: test** in the **Command Palette**.

![Test Commands](images/go/testcommands.png)

The first three above can be used to generate test skeletons for the functions in the current package, file, or at the cursor using `gotests`. The last few can be used to run tests in the current package, file, or at the cursor using `go test`. There is also a command for getting test coverage.

Import packages
---------------

Run the command **Go: Add Import** to get a list of packages that can be imported to your Go file. Choose one and it will get added in the import block of your Go file.

Rename symbols
--------------

You can rename symbols using `kb(editor.action.rename)` or by running the **Rename Symbol** command in the context menu in the editor.

Debugging
---------

The Go extension lets you debug Go code as well. You will need to install the [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger manually as a prerequisite. Read [Debug Go programs in VS Code](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md) for setup steps, information on remote debugging and a troubleshooting guide.
