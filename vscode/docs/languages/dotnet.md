# Using .NET Core in Visual Studio Code

[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core) provides a fast and modular platform for creating server apps that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C\# and F\# extensions to get a powerful editing experience with [C\# IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-intellisense), F\# IntelliSense (smart code completion), and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). The SDK also includes the Runtime.
- The [C\# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.
- The [F\# extension (Ionide)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

## Create a C\# “Hello World” app

1.  Initialize a C\# project:

    - Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you’d like to create the app.
    - Enter the following command in the command shell:

    <!-- -->

          dotnet new console

2.  When the project folder is first opened in VS Code:

    - A “Required assets to build and debug are missing. Add them?” notification appears at the bottom right of the window.
    - Select **Yes**.

3.  Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:

        dotnet run

## Create an F\# “Hello World” app

1.  Initialize an F\# project:

    - Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you’d like to create the app.
    - Enter the following command in the command shell:

    <!-- -->

        dotnet new console -lang "F#"

2.  Once it completes, open the project in Visual Studio Code:

        code .

3.  Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:

         dotnet run
