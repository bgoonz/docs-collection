      Support for Java in Visual Studio Code is provided through a wide range of
      <a href="/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md">extensions</a>. Combined
      with the power of core VS Code, these extensions give you a lightweight
      and performant code editor that also supports many of the most common Java
      development techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article will give you an overview of different capabilities of Visual
      Studio Code for Java developers. For a quick walkthrough of editing,
      running, and debugging a Java program with Visual Studio Code, use the

      VS Code provides essential language features such as code completion,
      refactoring, linting, formatting, and code snippets along with convenient
      debugging and unit test support. VS Code also integrates with tooling and
      frameworks such as Maven, Tomcat, Jetty, and Spring Boot. Leveraging the
      power of Visual Studio Code, Java developers get an excellent tool for
      both quick code editing and also the full debugging and testing cycle.
      It’s a great choice for your Java work if you’re looking for a tool which:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is fast, lightweight, free, and open source.</li>
      <li>Supports many other languages, not just Java.</li>
      <li>
        Helps start your Java journey without installing and learning a complex
        IDE.
      </li>
      <li>

      Thanks to the great Java community around VS Code, the list doesn’t end
      there. You can search for more Java extensions easily within VS Code:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Go to the <strong>Extensions</strong> view
        (<code>kb(workbench.view.extensions)</code>).
      </li>
      <li>Filter the extensions list by typing “java”.</li>
    </ol>

      <img src="images/java/extensions.png" alt="Java Extensions" />
      <figcaption>Java Extensions</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This document describes some of the key features included in those Java
      extensions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using VS Code on Windows and want to
      take advantage of the Windows Subsystem for Linux, see
      <a href="/docs/remote/wsl">Developing in WSL</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start, you must have the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) on your
      local environment. To run the VS Code for Java extension, Java SE 11 or
      above version is required; for projects, VS Code for Java supports
      projects with version 1.5 or above. For how to configure, refer to
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md#configure-jdk">Configure JDK</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For developers new to Java or new to VS Code, we provide a Getting Started
      experience. Once you’ve installed the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack"
        >Java Extension Pack</a
      >, you can open the Getting Started experience from within VS Code with
      the <strong>Java: Getting Started</strong> command from the Command
      Palette. Open the Command Palette
      (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>) and type “Java: Getting
      Started”.

    </figure>
    <h2 id="working-with-java-source-files">Working with Java source files</h2>
    <p>
      You can use VS Code to read, write, run, and debug Java source file(s)
      without creating a project. VS Code for Java supports two modes,
      lightweight and standard. Lightweight mode is ideal for scenarios that
      only deal with source file(s). If you want to work with a full scale
      project, standard mode will be required. You can easily switch from
      lightweight mode to standard mode, when needed. To learn more, see
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md#lightweight-mode">Lightweight Mode</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="working-with-java-project">Working with Java project</h2>
    <p>
      There are three things you must understand to work with Java in VS Code:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>How does VS Code handle Workspaces?</li>
      <li>How does VS Code handle Java?</li>
      <li>How does VS Code handle Workspaces that contain Java?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="vs-code-workspaces">VS Code Workspaces</h3>
    <p>
      In Visual Studio Code, a “Workspace” means a collection of one or more
      filesystem folders (and their children) and all of the VS Code
      configurations that take effect when that “Workspace” is open in VS Code.
      There are two kinds of “Workspaces” in VS Code, “folder workspaces” and
      “multi-root workspaces”.
    </p>
    <p>
      A “folder workspace” is presented by VS Code when you open a filesystem
      folder (directory) in VS Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      A “multi-root workspace” can refer to multiple folders (directories) from
      disparate parts of the file system and VS Code displays the contents of
      the folder(s) of the workspace together in the
      <a href="/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md#basic-layout">File Explorer</a
      >. To learn more, see
      <a href="/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces.md">Multi-root Workspaces</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="java-project-in-vs-code">Java project in VS Code</h3>
    <p>
      In contrast to IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, or Eclipse, the
      concept of a “Java project” is provided entirely by extensions, and is not
      a core concept in the base VS Code. When working with “Java projects” in
      VS Code, you must have the necessary extensions installed to work with
      those project files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, Maven, Eclipse, and Gradle Java projects are supported
      through
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java"
        >Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat</a
      >, by utilizing <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/">M2Eclipse</a>,
      which provides Maven support, and
      <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/buildship">Buildship</a>, which
      provides Gradle support through the
      <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls"
        >Eclipse JDT Language Server</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      With
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven"
        >Maven for Java</a
      >, you can generate projects from
      <a
        href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html"
        >Maven Archetypes</a
      >, browse through all the Maven projects within your workspace, and
      execute Maven goals easily from an embedded explorer. Projects can also be
      created and managed with the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-dependency"
        >Project Manager for Java</a
      >
      extension.
    </p>
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls>
      <source src="/docs/languages/java/package-viewer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code also supports working with standalone Java files
      outside of a Java project, described in the
      <a href="/docs/java/java-tutorial.md">Java Tutorial with VS Code</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vs-code-workspaces-that-contain-java-project">
      VS Code Workspaces that contain Java project
    </h3>
    <p>
      Assuming the necessary Java extensions are installed, opening a VS Code
      workspace that contains Java artifacts will cause those extensions to
      understand those artifacts and present options for working with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      More details about Java project support can be found in
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md"
        >Java Project Management in Visual Studio Code</a
      >
      and <a href="/docs/java/java-build.md">Build Tools</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>
    <h3 id="code-navigation">Code Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      Java in Visual Studio Code also supports source code navigation features
      such as search for symbol, Peek Definition, and Go to Definition. The
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot"
        >Spring Boot Tools</a
      >
      extension provides enhanced navigation and code completion support for
      <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key advantages of VS Code is speed. When you open your Java
      source file or folder, within a few seconds, with the help of
      <a href="/docs/java/java-project.md#lightweight-mode">Lightweight Mode</a
      >, you will be able to navigate your code base with Outline view as well
      as commands such as <strong>Go to Definition</strong> and
      <strong>Go to Reference</strong>. This is especially useful when you open
      a project for the first time.
    </p>
    <h3 id="code-completion">Code Completion</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/docs/editor/intellisense.md">IntelliSense</a> is a general term
      for language features, including intelligent code completion (in-context
      method and variable suggestions) across all your files and for built-in
      and third-party modules. VS Code supports code completion and IntelliSense
      for Java through
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java"
        >Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat</a
      >. It also provides AI-assisted IntelliSense called
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/"
        >IntelliCode</a
      >
      by putting what you’re most likely to use at the top of your completion
      list.
