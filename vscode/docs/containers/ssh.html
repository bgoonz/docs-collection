      Connect to remote Docker over SSH

    <p>
      We recommend using the Visual Studio Code
      <a href="/docs/containers/choosing-dev-environment.md#remote-machine"
        >Remote-SSH extension</a
      >
      to connect to a remote machine running Docker engine, but it also possible
      to connect to the remote Docker engine directly, using SSH tunneling.

          Use <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen">ssh-keygen</a> or similar
          to get and configure a public/private key pair for SSH authentication.
          Password authentication is not supported by Docker and not possible
          with a <code>DOCKER_HOST</code>-based configuration. If a key pair has
          already been set up, it can be used.

              <strong>Windows (OpenSSH):</strong> The latest version(s) of
              Windows 10 include OpenSSH by default. There is a Windows service,
              <code>ssh-agent</code> that is disabled by default, and needs to
              be re-enabled and set to automatic start. From an admin command
              prompt, run <code>sc config ssh-agent start=auto</code> and
              <code>net start ssh-agent</code>. Then, do
              <code>ssh-add &lt;keyfile&gt;</code>.

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Windows (Pageant):</strong> You can use Pageant instead of
              OpenSSH, in which case it is necessary to set the environment
              variable <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK=pageant</code>. Making that a user or
              system environment variable will be easiest.

              <strong>Linux:</strong> <code>ssh-agent</code> is present by
              default. Do <code>ssh-add &lt;keyfile&gt;</code>. Ubuntu was
              tested; you might have different results on other distributions.

              <strong>macOS:</strong> <code>ssh-agent</code> is present by
              default, but <code>ssh-add</code> does not persist across logins.
              Do <code>ssh-add &lt;keyfile&gt;</code>. We recommend configuring
              VS Code to run this command on terminal startup with
              <code>terminal.integrated.shellArgs.osx</code> or otherwise
              configuring a startup script. You can also manually run that
              command each login.

        <p>
          Verify that your identity is available to the agent with
          <code>ssh-add -l</code>. It should list one or more identities that
          look something like
          <code>2048 SHA256:abcdefghijk somethingsomething (RSA)</code>. If it
          does not list any identity, you will not be able to connect. Also, it
          needs to have the right identity. The Docker CLI working does not mean
          that the Explorer window will work. The Explorer window uses
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode">dockerode</a> (which
          in turn uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssh2">ssh2</a>),
          whereas the Docker CLI uses the <code>ssh</code> command, and benefits
          from an automatically inferred configuration.

      <li>
        <p>
          Create a
          <a
            href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts/"
            >Docker context</a
          >
          that points to the remote machine running Docker. Use
          <code>ssh://username@host:port</code> as the Docker endpoint (replace
          “host” with your remote machine name, or the remote machine IP
          address). Issue the following command from terminal window:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="shell"
        ><code>docker context create my-remote-docker-machine --docker &quot;host=ssh://username@host:port&quot;</code></pre>
        <p>
          Always include the user name in the Docker endpoint address, even if
          it is the same as the local user name. If you omit the port, it
          defaults to 22.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the
          <strong>Command Palette</strong>
          (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>) to issue the
          <strong>Docker Context: Use</strong> command to activate the Docker
          context pointing to the remote machine. This command causes both VS
          Code and Docker CLI to use the remote machine context.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is recommended to change the refresh rate to something longer than
          the default with the
          <code>docker.explorerRefreshInterval</code> setting. The connection
          over SSH is slow, and it can result in trying to refresh again before
          the previous refresh even finished. We recommend at least 3000 ms.

    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The “host” part in the Docker endpoint string
          (<code>ssh://username@host:port</code>) must be either a
          globally-resolvable DNS machine name, or an IP address. Docker
          extension will not be able to use host aliases defined in the
          <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/config/">SSH configuration file</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure the remote machine host key is already memorized
          <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/key/#known-host-keys"
            >in the known_hosts file</a
          >. The simplest way to ensure this is to connect to the machine via
          <code>ssh</code> client program (run
          <code>ssh username@host:port</code> from the command line). Upon
          first-time connection, the <code>ssh</code> program will display the
          host key and let you approve it, updating the
          <code>known_hosts</code> file automatically.

          There is <a
            href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1263"
            >an issue with ssh-keygen utility that comes with Windows 10 build
            1909 and older</a
          > that prevents it from working properly with newer SSH daemons (for
          example, the one that comes with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and newer). The
          workaround is to use ECDSA-type key, not RSA-type key, for the SSH
          connection. You can generate an ECDSA SSH key and add it to SSH agent
          with following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="shell"><code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
ssh-add id_ecdsa</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Windows 10 build 1909 and older are affected by
          <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1234"
            >an issue that prevents SSH from getting to your identities after
            Windows OS update</a
          >. The workaround is to add a dummy service entry to system
          configuration. Run the following from administrative command prompt
          window:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="shell"
        ><code>sc create sshd binPath=C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe</code></pre>
