    <p>
      SSH, or the secure shell protocol, lets you access a remote computer or
      virtual machine securely over a network connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can connect over SSH into another machine from Visual Studio Code and
      interact with files and folders anywhere on that remote filesystem. If you
      have an app located on a different computer, you could use SSH to connect
      to it and access your app, view its files, and even modify, run, and debug
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also take advantage of any tools or dependencies installed on that
      remote machine. You could connect to remote machines very different than
      your local machine. For instance, they could have a different operating
      system, different tools installed, or much stronger computing power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the classroom, you might SSH into lab machines to access computers with
      certain dependencies required for an assignment (like a specific version
      of Python or a C++ compiler), a different operating system than your own,
      or source code or automatic tests pre-loaded from your professor.

      Get started with SSH in VS Code
    </h2>
    <p>
      To get started with using SSH in VS Code, youâ€™ll need to download the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh"
        >Remote - SSH extension</a
      >
      from the Extension Marketplace.

      action:

      As demonstrated above, we can SSH into a more powerful virtual machine to
      greatly speed up the execution time of our programs.
