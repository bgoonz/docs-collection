      What are custom development environments?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your development environment is where you do your coding. Visual Studio
      Code allows you to use a development environment different than your local
      computer through a container, a separate (or remote) machine, or the
      Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). These configurations are known as
      <a href="/docs/remote/remote-overview.md">remote development</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Remote development has benefits such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid having to download different dependencies or manage multiple
        versions of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect to a machine with characteristics different than your own.
        <ul>
          <li>
            This could include greater compute power, which can make your
            programs run faster, or a different operating system, which will
            make sure your apps behave consistently when run in different
            locations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Develop Linux-based apps and use Linux commands while on Windows.</li>
      <li>
        Access existing development environments or code bases from multiple
        computers or locations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="example-scenario">Example scenario</h3>
    <p>
      As an example scenario, you could have different dev environments for
      Python 2.7 and 3.7. Rather than having to worry about managing different
      versions of Python on your computer, you can connect to separate
      environments with the appropriate versions of Python already set up for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you may be working with teammates using Linux or deploying to a
      Linux production environment, you could also connect to development
      environments that use a different operating system than your own, or
      harness the power of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

          >Remote - Containers</a
        >
        - Develop within a container, which is a piece of software that includes
        your app and any dependencies your app needs to run.
      </li>

        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
