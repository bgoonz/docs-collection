    <p>
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/liveshare">Live Share</a>
      enables you to quickly collaborate with a friend, classmate, or professor
      on the same code without the need to sync code or to configure the same
      development tools, settings, or environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to Live Share, seeing is believing. Check out this video to
      see Live Share in action:

    <p>
      When you share a collaborative session, the person you’re working with
      sees the context of the workspace in their editor. This means your
      classmate can read the code you shared without having to clone a repo or
      install any dependencies your code relies on. They can help you with your
      code in the Visual Studio Code environment that’s familiar to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of you can open files, navigate, edit code, or highlight - and
      changes are instantly reflected. As you edit you can see your classmate’s
      cursor, jump to the same location, and follow their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also debug together using VS Code’s debugging features, like
      hovers, locals and watches, the stack trace or the debug console. You are
      both able to set breakpoints and advance the debug cursor to step through
      the session.

    <h2 id="get-started-with-live-share">Get started with Live Share</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with using Live Share in VS Code, you’ll need to download
      the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack"
        >Live Share Extension Pack</a
      >
      from the Extension Marketplace.

    </figure>
    <p>
      This extension pack includes everything you need to start collaboratively
      editing and debugging in real time, including integrated audio and text
      chat. This provides you and your team/class with a one-click installation,
      in order to begin pair programming, performing remote code reviews,
      driving interactive lectures, and more, without needing to leave Visual
      Studio Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you log into your GitHub account, you’ll see the Live Share icon in
      the Activity Bar.

      If you select <strong>Start Collaboration session</strong> from the
      Session Details menu, an invitation link to your session will
      automatically be copied to your clipboard. You can share this link with
      anyone you’d like to collaborate with, as long as they also have VS Code
      and the Live Share Extension Pack downloaded.
