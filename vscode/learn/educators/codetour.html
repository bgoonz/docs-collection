      Helping students understand a new codebase can be challenging and time
      consuming. Creating descriptive enough instructions can be cumbersome and
      still not easy enough for students to follow. CodeTour can help you
      introduce your students to your assignments and projects in a streamlined
      and interactive way.

        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour"
        >CodeTour</a
      >
      is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to create a step-by-step
      guide through your codebases. This can be helpful in your classroom to
      break up your assignments into steps for students to follow or to get them
      familiar with all parts of the assignment by pointing them to relevant
      pieces within the assignment.

      In the short video below, an instructor is removing existing instructions
      embedded in the source code and replacing them with CodeTour steps so
      students can jump from step to step in the large game development project:

      Essentially, a “code tour” is simply a series of interactive steps, each
      of which are associated with a specific directory, or file/line, and
      include a description of the respective code. Tours can either be checked
      into a repo to share with source control, or exported to a “tour file”,
      which allows anyone to replay the same tour, without having to clone any
      code!

      We’ve used CodeTour in the Microsoft partnered Space Jam lessons:

      CodeTour helps guide the self-paced learners through

      Here is a short clip of a student using CodeTour to start working on their
      basketball web app:

      To start using CodeTour, you’ll need to download the CodeTour extension
      from the VS Code
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">Marketplace</a>.
