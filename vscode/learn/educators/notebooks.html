        >Jupyter Notebooks</a
      >
      are documents that contain a mix of live code (Python, R, Julia,
      JavaScript, and more), visualizations, and narrative text (Markdown).
      They’re useful for breaking down concepts in a story telling form, where
      you can give some context and show the code below along with interactive
      visualizations.
    </p>

      What do they look like in a classroom?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Below are several real life examples of how Jupyter Notebooks can be used
      in classrooms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h2>
    <p>
      Notebooks can be useful for explaining large topics, piece by piece, with
      rich imagery and videos embedded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here one instructor is using extra visualizations and pseudo-code to help
      students code their merge sort implementation.
    </p>

      This instructor is explaining how time complexities work broken down with
      tables of data, graphs, explanations, and code:

        alt="Lecture explaining time complexities"
      />
      <figcaption>Lecture explaining time complexities</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It’s also a great way to see and compare the exact runtimes of code
      blocks, which can be very helpful for learning data structures and
      algorithm fundamentals.
    </p>
    <h2 id="interactive-output">Interactive output</h2>
    <p>
      Jupyter Notebooks can also have rich interactive outputs. The instructor
      below is creating a Notebook for a lecture about the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem"
        >maximum flow problem</a
      >
      and utilizing the
      <a
        href="https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#getting-started"
        >pyviz library</a
      >
      to make an interactive network graph to visualize the problem description.
      They are also utilizing the built-in
      <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> support to show
      mathematical symbols for the problem constraints.
    </p>
    <figure>

      />
      <figcaption>Lecture notes for maximum flow problem</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="rich-assignments">Rich assignments</h2>
    <p>
      They are also a great format for handing out assignments. Here an
      instructor created an assignment to teach Binary Search Trees that
      includes a mix of students needing to implement code and write long form
      written responses to theoretical questions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine along with the
      Microsoft
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python"
        >Python extension</a
      >
      installed from the VS Code Marketplace. You can review the
      <a href="/docs/python/python-tutorial.md">introductory Python tutorial</a>
      for help with setup.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, you need to install the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter"
        >Jupyter Notebooks extension</a
      >.
    </p>
    <figure>

        alt="Jupyter extension in VS Code Marketplace"
      />
      <figcaption>Jupyter extension in VS Code Marketplace</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Once you have Python and the extensions installed, you will need to
      activate the Python environment by using the command
      <strong>Python: Select Interpreter</strong> from the Command Palette
      (<code>kb(workbench.action.showCommands)</code>).
