      In this tutorial, you learned how to build a fully-featured Hackernews
      clone with React and
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>. You implemented
      several features, such as displaying a list of links, signup and
      authentication, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as
      realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to extend this app, start a new one, or play around more with
      urql! If you have any closing questions or need some help, you can

        >reach out to the urql community &amp; team on Spectrum</a
      >!
    </p>
    <p>
      Both <code>urql</code> and <code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code> are
      powerful yet minimal tools that have a lot more to offer than what we’ve
      shown you in this tutorial! If you’d like to learn more, maybe check out

        updates, cache resolvers, and more!

    <h3 id="node.js-server">Node.js Server</h3>
    <p>
      To learn how to build the backend that you used for this tutorial, check
      out the
      <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/"
        >Node.JS tutorial</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend was powered by
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga"
        ><code>graphql-yoga</code></a
      >, a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of
      <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>. It comes with several
      features, such as out-of-the-box support for
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground"
        >GraphQL Playground</a
      >
      and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma
      client that’s responsible for database access.
    </p>
