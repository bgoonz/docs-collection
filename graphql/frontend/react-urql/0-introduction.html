      <strong>Note:</strong> The final project for this tutorial can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/howtographql/react-urql">GitHub</a>. You can
      always use it as a reference whenever you get lost throughout the course
      of the following chapters. Also note that each code block is annotated
      with a filename. These annotations directly link to the corresponding file
      on GitHub, so you can clearly see where to put the code and what the end
      result will look like.

    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      In the previous tutorials, you learned about major concepts and benefits
      of GraphQL. Now is the time to get your hands dirty and start out with an
      actual project!
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re going to build a simple clone of
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a>. Here’s a list of
      the features the app will have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display a list of links</li>
      <li>Search the list of links</li>
      <li>Users can authenticate</li>
      <li>Authenticated users can create new links</li>
      <li>Authenticated users can upvote links (one vote per link and user)</li>
      <li>
        Realtime updates when other users upvote a link or create a new one
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this track, you’ll use the following technologies for building the app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Frontend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>: Frontend
            framework for building user interfaces

            <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>: Flexible
            and extensible GraphQL client for React
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="citation" data-cites="urql/exchange-graphcache"
              >[@urql/exchange-graphcache]</span
            >(https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache): A
            normalized cache implementation for urql
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Backend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga/"
              ><code>graphql-yoga</code></a
            >: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup,
            performance &amp; great developer experience
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>: Open-source GraphQL API
            layer that turns your database into a GraphQL API
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You’ll create the React project with
      <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app"
        ><code>create-react-app</code></a
      >, a popular command-line tool that gives you a blank project with all
      required build configuration already setup.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-a-graphql-client">Why a GraphQL Client?</h3>
    <p>
      In the <a href="/advanced/0-clients/">Clients</a> section in the GraphQL
      part, we already covered the responsibilities of a GraphQL client on a
      higher level, now it’s time to get more concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, you should use a GraphQL client for tasks that are repetitive
      and agnostic to the app you’re building. For example, being able to send
      queries and mutations without having to worry about lower-level networking
      details or maintaining a local cache. This is functionality you’ll want in
      any frontend application that’s talking to a GraphQL server - why build it
      yourself when you can use one of the amazing GraphQL clients out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few GraphQL client libraries available, that all give you
      varying degrees of control over ongoing GraphQL operations and come with
      various different benefits and drawbacks. For very simple use cases (such
      as writing scripts),
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-request"
        ><code>graphql-request</code></a
      >
      might already be enough for your needs. Libraries like it are thin layers
      around sending HTTP requests to your GraphQL API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chances are that you’re writing a somewhat larger application where you
      want to benefit from caching, optimistic UI updates and other handy
      features. In these cases you’ll likely want to use a full GraphQL client
      that handles the lifecycle of all your GraphQL operations. You have the
      choice between <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo Client</a
      >, and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="urql-vs-apollo-vs-relay">urql vs Apollo vs Relay</h3>
    <p>
      The most common question heard from people that are getting started with
      GraphQL on the frontend is which GraphQL client they should use. We’ll try
      to provide a few hints that’ll help you decide which of these clients is
      the right one for your next project!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> is Facebook’s
      homegrown GraphQL client that they open-sourced alongside GraphQL in 2015.
      It incorporates all the learnings that Facebook gathered since they
      started using GraphQL in 2012. Relay is heavily optimized for performance
      and comes with an opinionated structure that helps you manage a high level
      of complexity with ease. An interesting side-note is that Relay itself
      actually started out as a <em>routing</em> framework that eventually got
      combined with data loading responsibilities. It thus evolved into a
      powerful data management solution that can be used in JavaScript apps to
      interface with GraphQL APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance benefits of Relay come at the cost of a notable learning
      curve. Relay is a pretty complex framework and understanding all its bits
      and pieces does require some time to really get into it. The overall
      situation in that respect has improved with the release of the 1.0
      version, called
      <a
        href="http://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/introduction-to-relay.html"
        >Relay Modern</a
      >, but if you’re looking for something to customize or easy to get started
      with, Relay might not be the right choice just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo Client</a>
      is a community-driven effort to build an easy-to-understand, flexible and
      powerful GraphQL client. Apollo has the ambition to build one library for
      every major development platform that people use to build web and mobile
      applications. Right now there is a JavaScript client with bindings for
      popular frameworks like
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo">React</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular">Angular</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client">Ember</a> or
      <a href="https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo">Vue</a> as well as early
      versions of
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios">iOS</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android">Android</a>
      clients. Apollo is production-ready and has handy features like caching,
      optimistic UI, subscription support and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a> is a more
      dynamic approach on GraphQL clients and a newer project compared to Relay
      and Apollo. While it’s highly focused on React, at its core it focuses on
      simplicity and extensibility. It comes with the barebones to build an
      efficient GraphQL client, but gives you full control over how it processes
      GraphQL operations and results via “Exchanges”. Together with the
      first-party exchange
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache"
        ><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a
      >
      it is basically equivalent in functionality with Apollo, but with a
      smaller footprint and a very focused API.
