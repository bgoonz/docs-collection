In this chapter, you learned how to build a fully-featured Hackernews clone with VueJS and Apollo Client, specifically [vue-apollo](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo). You implemented several features, such as displaying a list of links, login functionality, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions.

Apollo is a flexible GraphQL client that can be used on all major development platforms. It has an intuitive API and implements handy features like caching, optimistic UI and subscriptions that let you focus on the important parts of your app.
