      In this chapter, you learned how to build a fully-featured Hackernews
      clone with VueJS and Apollo Client, specifically
      <a href="https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo">vue-apollo</a>. You
      implemented several features, such as displaying a list of links, login
      functionality, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as
      realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apollo is a flexible GraphQL client that can be used on all major
      development platforms. It has an intuitive API and implements handy
      features like caching, optimistic UI and subscriptions that let you focus
      on the important parts of your app.
