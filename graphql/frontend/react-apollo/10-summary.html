      In this tutorial, we covered how to build a fully-featured Hackernews
      clone with React and
      <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implemented several features such as displaying a list of links, signup
      and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, and pagination.
      We also built in realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions. For a longer
      tutorial that covers more advanced features of Apollo Client, check out
      the <a href="https://graphql.guide/">GraphQL Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn how to build the backend that we used for this tutorial, check
      out the
      <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/"
        >Node.JS tutorial</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend was powered by
      <a
        href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/"
        ><code>apollo-server</code></a
      >. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground"
        >GraphQL Playground</a
      >
      and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolvers for our GraphQL server use
      <a href="https://prisma.io">Prisma</a> for database access.
