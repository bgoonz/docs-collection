      <strong>Note:</strong> The final project for this tutorial can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/howtographql/react-apollo">GitHub</a>. You can
      always use it as a reference whenever you get lost throughout the course
      of the following chapters. Also note that each code block is annotated
      with a filename. These annotations directly link to the corresponding file
      on GitHub, so you can clearly see where to put the code and what the end

    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      In the previous tutorials, we covered the major concepts and benefits of
      GraphQL. Now is the time to get our hands dirty and start out with an
      actual project!
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re going to build a simple clone of
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a>. Here’s a list of
      the features the app will have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display a list of links</li>
      <li>Search the list of links</li>
      <li>Handle user authentication</li>
      <li>Allow authenticated users to create new links</li>
      <li>
        Allow authenticated users to upvote links (one vote per link and user)
      </li>
      <li>
        Realtime updates when other users upvote a link or create a new one
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this track, we’ll use the following technologies for building the app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Frontend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>: Library for
            building user interfaces
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client"
              >Apollo Client 3.2</a
            >: Production-ready, caching GraphQL client
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Backend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server"
              >Apollo Server 2.18</a
            >: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup,
            performance and great developer experience
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>: Open-source database
            toolkit that makes it simple to work with relational databases
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’ll create the React project with
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app"
        ><code>create-react-app</code></a
      >, a popular command-line tool that gives us a blank project with all
      required build configuration already setup.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-a-graphql-client">Why a GraphQL Client?</h3>
    <p>
      In the <a href="/advanced/0-clients/">Clients</a> section in the GraphQL
      part, we already covered the responsibilities of a GraphQL client on a
      higher level. It’s now time to get more concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, we should use a GraphQL client for tasks that are repetitive and
      agnostic to the app we’re building. For example, being able to send
      queries and mutations without having to worry about lower-level networking
      details or maintaining a local cache. This is functionality we’ll want in
      any frontend application that’s talking to a GraphQL server. Why build
      these features yourself when we can use one of the amazing GraphQL clients
      out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several GraphQL client libraries available that all give us
      varying degrees of control over ongoing GraphQL operations and come with
      different benefits and drawbacks. For very simple use cases (such as
      writing scripts),
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request"
        ><code>graphql-request</code></a
      >
      might already be enough for our needs. Libraries like it are thin layers
      around sending HTTP requests to our GraphQL API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chances are that you’re writing a somewhat larger application where you
      want to benefit from caching, optimistic UI updates and other handy
      features. In these cases you’ll likely want to use a full GraphQL client
      that handles the lifecycle of all your GraphQL operations. You have the
      choice between
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo Client</a
      >, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="apollo-vs-relay-vs-urql">Apollo vs Relay vs urql</h3>
    <p>
      The most common question heard from people that are getting started with
      GraphQL on the frontend is which GraphQL client they should use. We’ll try
      to provide a few hints that’ll help you decide which of these clients is
      the right one for your next project!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> is Facebook’s
      homegrown GraphQL client that they open-sourced alongside GraphQL in 2015.
      It incorporates all the learnings that Facebook gathered since they
      started using GraphQL in 2012. Relay is heavily optimized for performance
      and tries to reduce network traffic where possible. An interesting
      side-note is that Relay itself actually started out as a
      <em>routing</em> framework that eventually got combined with data loading
      responsibilities. It thus evolved into a powerful data management solution
      that can be used in JavaScript apps to interface with GraphQL APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance benefits of Relay come at the cost of a notable learning
      curve. Relay is a complex framework and understanding all of its
      intricacies does require some time. The overall situation in that respect
      has improved with the release of the 1.0 version, called
      <a
        href="http://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/introduction-to-relay.html"
        >Relay Modern</a
      >, but if you’re looking for something to <em>just get started</em> with
      GraphQL, Relay might not be the right choice just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo Client</a>
      is a community-driven effort to build an easy-to-understand, flexible and
      powerful GraphQL client. Apollo has the ambition to build one library for
      every major development platform that people use to build web and mobile
      applications. Right now there is a JavaScript client with bindings for
      popular frameworks like
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo">React</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular">Angular</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client">Ember</a> or
      <a href="https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo">Vue</a> as well as early
      versions of
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios">iOS</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android">Android</a>
      clients. Apollo is production-ready and has features like caching,
      optimistic UI, subscription support and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a> is a more
      dynamic approach on GraphQL clients and a newer project compared to Relay
      and Apollo. While it’s highly focused on React, at its core it focuses on
      simplicity and extensibility. It comes with the barebones to build an
      efficient GraphQL client, but gives you full control over how it processes
      GraphQL operations and results via “Exchanges”. Together with the
      first-party exchange
      <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache"
        ><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a
      >
      it is basically equivalent in functionality with Apollo, but with a
      smaller footprint and a very focused API.
