In this tutorial, we covered how to build a fully-featured Hackernews clone with React and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

We implemented several features such as displaying a list of links, signup and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, and pagination. We also built in realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions. For a longer tutorial that covers more advanced features of Apollo Client, check out the [GraphQL Guide](https://graphql.guide/).

To learn how to build the backend that we used for this tutorial, check out the [Node.JS tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/).

The backend was powered by [`apollo-server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/). It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers for our GraphQL server use [Prisma](https://prisma.io) for database access.
