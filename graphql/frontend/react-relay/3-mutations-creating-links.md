In this section, youâ€™ll learn how you can send mutations with Relay.

### Preparing the React components

Like before, letâ€™s start by writing the React component where users will be able to add new links.

Create a new file in the `src/components` directory and call it `CreateLink.js`. Then paste the following code into it:

    import React, { Component } from 'react'

    class CreateLink extends Component {

      state = {
        description: '',
        url: ''
      }

      render() {

        return (
          <div>
            <div className='flex flex-column mt3'>
              <input
                className='mb2'
                value={this.state.description}
                onChange={(e) => this.setState({ description: e.target.value })}
                type='text'
                placeholder='A description for the link'
              />
              <input
                className='mb2'
                value={this.state.url}
                onChange={(e) => this.setState({ url: e.target.value })}
                type='text'
                placeholder='The URL for the link'
              />
            </div>
            <div
              className='button'
              onClick={() => this._createLink()}
            >
              submit
            </div>
          </div>
        )

      }

      _createLink = () => {
        // ... you'll implement this in a bit
      }

    }

    export default CreateLink

This is a standard setup for a React component with two `input` fields where users can provide the `url` and `description` of the `Link` they want to create. The data thatâ€™s typed into these fields is stored in the componentâ€™s `state` and will be used in `_createLink` when the mutation is sent.

Great, but how can you now actually implement `_createLink` and send the mutation?

### Writing the Mutation

Mutations were one of the major pain points developers had with Relay Classic. The way that they were implemented was in a declarative and powerful way. However, it was very difficult to actually understand how they worked since there was so much _magic_ going on behind the scenes. As a result, the main concern was that theyâ€™re not predictable enough and developers had a hard time reasoning about them.

Thatâ€™s why one of the major goals of Relay Modern was also to introduce a new and more approachable mutation API. The Facebook team delivered that and Relay now exposes a more [_imperative_ API](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/mutations.html) that allows you to manipulate the local store directly (actually, the manipulation happens through a dedicated _proxy_ object, but itâ€™s definitely much more direct than before). Youâ€™ll learn about this new API to update the cache in a later chapter - for now weâ€™re only interested in performing a mutation to create a new link.

To implement the mutation for adding new links, first create a new directory called `mutations` in `src` and then create a new file called `CreateLinkMutation.js` that you put into that new directory. Then paste the following code into it:

    // 1
    import {
      commitMutation,
      graphql,
    } from 'react-relay'
    import environment from '../Environment'

    // 2
    const mutation = graphql`
      mutation CreateLinkMutation($input: CreateLinkInput!) {
        createLink(input: $input) {
          link {
            id
            createdAt
            url
            description
          }
        }
      }
    `

    // 3
    export default (description, url, callback) => {
      // 4
      const variables = {
        input: {
          description,
          url,
          clientMutationId: ""
        },
      }

      // 5
      commitMutation(
        environment,
        {
          mutation,
          variables,
          // 6
          onCompleted: () => {
            callback()
          },
          onError: err => console.error(err),
        },
      )
    }

Letâ€™s quickly walk through the different things that happen here:

1.  First you need to import the right modules from `react-relay` as well as the `environment`.
2.  Here you write a simple mutation and tag it with the `graphql` function. This mutation could also be used inside a Playground.
3.  The module exports a single function that takes in the postâ€™s `description` and `url` as well as a `callback` that will be called when the mutation is completed.
4.  Here you prepare the `input` object for the mutation that wraps the `description` and `url`. Note that the `clientMutationId` is required in this case because of a minor limitation in the Graphcool API - it has no function.
5.  The `commitMutation` function can be used to send a mutation to the server with Relay Modern. Youâ€™re passing the `variables` that you prepared in the previous steps and execute `commitMutation` once everything is ready.
6.  Once the mutation is fully completed, the callback that the caller passed in is invoked.

### Calling the Mutation

With the `CreateLinkMutation` in place, you now need to implement the functionality to actually call it. Youâ€™ll do that inside the `CreateLink` component.

Open `CreatLink.js` and implement `_createLink` like so:

    _createLink = () => {
      const { description, url } = this.state
      CreateLinkMutation(description, url, () => console.log(`Mutation completed`))
      }

For this code to work you also need to import the `CreateLinkMutation` at the top of the file:

    import CreateLinkMutation from '../mutations/CreateLinkMutation'

To test the mutation, you now need to render the `CreateLink` component inside the appâ€™s root component.

Open `App.js` and first import the `CreateLink` component on top of the file:

    import CreateLink from './CreateLink'

Next, still in `App.js`, update `render` to look as follows:

    render() {
      return (
        <CreateLink />
      )
    }

Before youâ€™re running the app to test the mutation, you need to invoke the Relay Compiler again.

In a terminal, navigate to the projectâ€™s root directory and call the following command:

    relay-compiler --src ./src --schema ./schema.graphql

This time, the `__generated__` directory is created in the `mutations` folder and contains a Javascript representation for the `CreateLinkMutation`.

You can now finally go ahead and test the mutation. Run `yarn start`, youâ€™ll be greeted with a very simple screen: Two input fields and a _submit_-button - not very pretty but functional.

Enter some data into the fields, e.g.:

- **Description**: `The best learning resource for GraphQL`
- **URL**: `www.howtographql.com`

Then click the _submit_-button. You wonâ€™t get any visual feedback in the UI, but if you open the browserâ€™s console, youâ€™ll see the string from the log statement that you passed as a `callback` being printed: `Mutation completed`.

You can validate if the mutation actually worked by checking the current list of links in a Playground.

Type `graphcool playground` into a Terminal and send the following query:

    {
      allLinks {
        description
        url
      }
    }

Youâ€™ll see the following server response:

    {
      "data": {
        "allLinks": [
          {
            "description": "The coolest GraphQL backend ðŸ˜Ž",
            "url": "https://graph.cool"
          },
          {
            "description": "Highly performant GraphQL client from Facebook",
            "url": "https://facebook.github.io/relay/"
          },
          {
            "description": "The best learning resource for GraphQL",
            "url": "www.howtographql.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Awesome! The mutation works, great job! ðŸ’ª
