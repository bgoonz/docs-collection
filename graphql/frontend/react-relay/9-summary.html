      In this chapter, you learned how to build a fully-feature Hackernews clone
      with React and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>. You
      implemented several features, such as displaying a list of links, login
      functionality, creating new links, voting on links as well as realtime
      updates with GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relay is an extremely powerful GraphQL client that’s developed by
      Facebook. It incorporates all major learnings that Facebook gathered since
      they started using GraphQL in 2012. Above all, Relay is heavily optimized
      for performance to minimize the amount of data that’s transferred over the
      network and to work well on low-powered mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s a notable learning curve for developers when getting started with
      Relay. The release of the 1.0 version, called
      <a
        href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/new-in-relay-modern.html"
        >Relay Modern</a
      >, generally made Relay more approachable and eliminated many issues that
      developer used to have with Relay Classic. However, the scarce
      documentation and lack of general examples still make it a challenge to
      adopt Relay in a project.
