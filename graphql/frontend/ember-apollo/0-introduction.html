        <strong>NOTE</strong>: This tutorial uses the

          >legacy</a

        version of <a href="https://www.graph.cool/">Graphcool</a> and will be
        updated soon to use the new
        <a
          href="https://blog.graph.cool/introducing-the-graphcool-framework-d9edab2a7816"
          >Graphcool Framework</a

        more about the new CLI

          >here</a

        old version of the CLI using <code>npm install -g graphcool@0.4</code>.

    <p>
      In the previous tutorials, you learned about major concepts and benefits
      of GraphQL. Now is the time to get your hands dirty and start out with an
      actual project!
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re going to build a simple clone of
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a>. Here’s a list of
      the features the app will have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display a list of links</li>
      <li>Search the list of links</li>
      <li>Users can authenticate</li>
      <li>Authenticated users can create new links</li>
      <li>Authenticated users can upvote links (one vote per link and user)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this track, you’ll use the following technologies for building the app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Frontend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>: A framework for creating
            ambitious web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://dev.apollodata.com/">Apollo Client</a>:
            Fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Backend:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.graph.cool/">Graphcool</a>: Flexible backend
            platform combining GraphQL + Serverless
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You’ll create the Ember project with
      <a href="http://ember-cli.com/">ember-cli</a>, the command line interface
      for ambitious web applications. <code>ember-cli</code> will start you off
      with a blank project with all required build configuration already setup.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-a-graphql-client">Why a GraphQL Client?</h3>
    <p>
      In the
      <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/0-clients/">Clients</a>
      section in the GraphQL part, you already covered the responsibilities of a
      GraphQL client on a higher level, now it’s time to get bit more concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, you should use a GraphQL client for tasks that are repetitive
      and agnostic to the app you’re building. For example, being able to send
      queries and mutations without having to worry about lower-level networking
      details or maintaining a local cache. This is functionality that you’ll
      want in any frontend application that’s talking to a GraphQL server - why
      build it yourself if you can use one of the amazing GraphQL clients out
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few GraphQL client libraries available. For very simple use
      cases (such as writing scripts),
      <a href="https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request"
        ><code>graphql-request</code></a
      >
      might already be enough for your needs. However, chances are that you’re
      writing a somewhat larger application where you want to benefit from
      caching, optimistic UI updates, and other handy features. In these cases,
      <a href="http://dev.apollodata.com/">Apollo Client</a> is the only
      solution that currently works with Ember.
    </p>
    <h3 id="apollo-client">Apollo Client</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://dev.apollodata.com/">Apollo Client</a> is a
      community-driven effort to build an easy-to-understand, flexible and
      powerful GraphQL client. Apollo has the ambition to build one library for
      every major development platform that people use to build web and mobile
      applications. Right now there is a JavaScript client with bindings for
      popular frameworks like
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo">React</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular">Angular</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client">Ember</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo">Vue</a> as well as early
      versions of
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios">iOS</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android">Android</a>.
      Apollo is production-ready and has handy features like caching, optimistic
      UI, subscription support and many more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ember-apollo-client"><code>ember-apollo-client</code></h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial will use the
      <a href="https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client"
        ><code>ember-apollo-client</code></a
      >
      library which is an <code>ember-cli</code> add-on that exposes a service
      to interact with Apollo. <code>ember-apollo-client</code> is still in it’s
      infancy so not all Apollo features have been implemented. The most notable
      feature of which is subscriptions. This tutorial will be updated as
      features are added to the library, so continually check back for new
      sections!
