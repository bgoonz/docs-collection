      Working with a GraphQL API on the frontend is a great opportunity to
      develop new abstractions and help implement common functionality on the
      client-side. Let’s consider some “infrastructure” features that you
      probably want to have in your app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        send queries and mutations directly without constructing HTTP requests
      </li>
      <li>view-layer integration</li>
      <li>caching</li>
      <li>validation and optimization of queries based on the schema</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, nothing stops you from using plain HTTP to fetch your data and
      then shifting all the bits yourself until the right information ends up in
      your UI. But, GraphQL provides the ability to abstract away a lot of the
      manual work you’d usually have to do during that process and lets you
      focus on the real important parts of your app! In the following, we’ll
      discuss in a bit more detail what these tasks are.
    </p>

      <p>
        There are two major GraphQL clients available at the moment. The first
        one is
        <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client"
          >Apollo Client</a
        >, which is a community-driven effort to build a powerful and flexible
        GraphQL client for all major development platforms. The second one is
        called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> and it is
        Facebook’s homegrown GraphQL client that heavily optimizes for
        performance and is only available on the web.

      Send Queries and Mutations Directly

    <p>
      One major benefit of GraphQL is that it allows you to fetch and update
      data in a <em>declarative</em> manner. Put differently, we climb up one
      step higher on the API abstraction ladder and don’t have to deal with
      low-level networking tasks ourselves anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where you previously used plain HTTP (like <code>fetch</code> in
      Javascript or <code>NSURLSession</code> on iOS) to load data from an API,
      all you need with GraphQL is a query where you declare your data
      requirements and let the system take care of sending the request and
      handling the response for you. This is precisely what a GraphQL client
      will do.
    </p>
    <h3 id="view-layer-integrations-ui-updates">
      View Layer Integrations &amp; UI updates
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once the server response is received and handled by the GraphQL client,
      the requested data somehow needs to end up in your UI. Depending on the
      platforms and frameworks you’re developing with, there will be different
      approaches to how UI updates are handled in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking React as an example, GraphQL clients use the concept of
      <a
        href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html"
        >higher-order components</a
      >
      to fetch the needed data under the hood and make it available in the
      <code>props</code> of your components. In general, the declarative nature
      of GraphQL ties in particularly well with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming"
        >functional reactive programming</a
      >
      techniques. These two form a powerful combination where a view simply
      declares its data dependencies and the UI is wired up with an FRP layer of
      your choice.
    </p>
    <h3 id="caching-query-results-concepts-and-strategies">
      Caching Query Results: Concepts and Strategies
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the majority of applications, you’ll want to maintain a cache of the
      data that was previously fetched from the server. Caching information
      locally is essential to provide a fluent user experience and also takes
      the load off your users’ data plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, when caching data, the intuition is to put information that’s
      fetched remotely into a local <em>store</em> from where it can be
      retrieved later on. With GraphQL, the naive approach would be to simply
      put the results of GraphQL queries into the store and simply return them
      whenever the same query is sent. It turns out this approach is very
      inefficient for most applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more beneficial approach is to <em>normalize</em> the data beforehand.
      That means that the (potentially nested) query result gets flattened and
      the store will only contain individual records that can be referenced with
      a globally unique ID. If you want to learn more about this, the
      <a
        href="https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-concepts-of-graphql-bc68bd819be3"
        >Apollo blog</a
      >
      has a great write-up on the topic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="build-time-schema-validation-optimizations">
      Build-time Schema Validation &amp; Optimizations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since the schema contains <em>all</em> information about what a client can
      potentially do with a GraphQL API, there is a great opportunity to
      validate and potentially optimize the queries that a client wants to send
      already at build-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the build environment has access to the schema, it can essentially
      parse all the GraphQL code that’s located in the project and compare it
      against the information from the schema. This catches typos and other
      errors before an application gets into the hands of actual users where the
      consequences of an error would be a lot more drastic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="colocating-views-and-data-dependencies">
      Colocating Views and Data Dependencies
    </h3>
    <p>
      A powerful concept of GraphQL is that it allows you to have UI code and
      data requirements side-by-side. The tight coupling of views and their data
      dependencies greatly improves the developer experience. The mental
      overhead of thinking about how the right data ends up in the right parts
      of the UI is eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well colocation works depends on the platform you’re developing on.
      For example in Javascript applications, it’s possible to actually put data
      dependencies and UI code into the same file. In Xcode, the
      <em>Assistant Editor</em> can be used to work on view controllers and
      graphql code at the same time.
