      GraphQL gives enormous power to clients. But with great power come great
      responsibilities ðŸ•·.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since clients have the possibility to craft very complex queries, our
      servers must be ready to handle them properly. These queries may be
      abusive queries from evil clients, or may simply be very large queries
      used by legitimate clients. In both of these cases, the client can
      potentially take your GraphQL server down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few strategies to mitigate these risks. We will cover them in
      this chapter in order from the simplest to the most complex, and look at
      their pros and cons.
    </p>
    <h2 id="timeout">Timeout</h2>
    <p>
      The first strategy and the simplest one is using a timeout to defend
      against large queries. This strategy is the simplest since it does not
      require the server to know anything about the incoming queries. All the
      server knows is the maximum time allowed for a query.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a server configured with a 5 seconds timeout would stop the
      execution of any query that is taking more than 5 seconds to execute.
    </p>
    <h3 id="timeout-pros">Timeout Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple to implement.</li>
      <li>Most strategies will still use a timeout as a final protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="timeout-cons">Timeout Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Damage can already be done even when the timeout kicks in.</li>
      <li>
        Sometimes hard to implement. Cutting connections after a certain time
        may result in strange behaviours.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="maximum-query-depth">Maximum Query Depth</h2>
    <p>
      As we covered earlier, clients using GraphQL may craft any complex query
      they want. Since GraphQL schemas are often cyclic graphs, this means a
      client could craft a query like this one:
    </p>
    <pre class="graphql"><code>query IAmEvil {
  author(id: &quot;abc&quot;) {
    posts {
      author {
        posts {
          author {
            posts {
              author {
                # that could go on as deep as the client wants!
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      What if we could prevent clients from abusing query depth like this?
      Knowing your schema might give you an idea of how deep a legitimate query
      can go. This is actually possible to implement and is often called Maximum
      Query Depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analyzing the query documentâ€™s abstract syntax tree (AST), a GraphQL
      server is able to reject or accept a request based on its depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take for example a server configured with a Maximum Query Depth of
      <code>3</code>, and the following query document. Everything within the
      red marker is considered too deep and the query is invalid.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6RqfhK8.png" alt="Query Depth Example" />
      <figcaption>Query Depth Example</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Using <code>graphql-ruby</code> with the max query depth setting, we get
      the following result:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode json"
      ><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">&quot;errors&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3">    <span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" title="4">      <span class="dt">&quot;message&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;Query has depth of 6, which exceeds max depth of 3&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" title="5">    <span class="fu">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" title="6">  <span class="ot">]</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" title="7"><span class="fu">}</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <h3 id="maximum-query-depth-pros">Maximum Query Depth Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since the AST of the document is analyzed statically, the query does not
        even execute, which adds no load on your GraphQL server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="maximum-query-depth-cons">Maximum Query Depth Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Depth alone is often not enough to cover all abusive queries. For
        example, a query requesting an enormous amount of nodes on the root will
        be very expensive but unlikely to be blocked by a query depth analyzer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="query-complexity">Query Complexity</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the depth of a query is not enough to truly know how large or
      expensive a GraphQL query will be. In a lot of cases, certain fields in
      our schema are known to be more complex to compute than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Query complexity allows you to define how complex these fields are, and to
      restrict queries with a maximum complexity. The idea is to define how
      complex each field is by using a simple number. A common default is to
      give each field a complexity of <code>1</code>. Take this query for
      example:
    </p>
    <pre class="graphql"><code>query {
  author(id: &quot;abc&quot;) { # complexity: 1
    posts {           # complexity: 1
      title           # complexity: 1
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      A simple addition gives us a total of <code>3</code> for the complexity of
      this query. If we were to set a max complexity of <code>2</code> on our
      schema, this query would fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if the <code>posts</code> field is actually much more complex than
      the <code>author</code> field? We can set a different complexity to the
      field. We can even set a different complexity depending on arguments!
      Letâ€™s take a look at a similar query, where <code>posts</code> has a
      variable complexity depending on its arguments:
    </p>
    <pre class="graphql"><code>query {
  author(id: &quot;abc&quot;) {    # complexity: 1
    posts(first: 5) {    # complexity: 5
      title              # complexity: 1
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <h3 id="query-complexity-pros">Query Complexity Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers more cases than a simple query depth.</li>
      <li>
        Reject queries before executing them by statically analyzing the
        complexity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="query-complexity-cons">Query Complexity Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard to implement perfectly.</li>
      <li>
        If complexity is estimated by developers, how do we keep it up to date?
        How do we find the costs in the first place?
      </li>
      <li>
        Mutations are hard to estimate. What if they have a side effect that is
        hard to measure, like queuing a background job?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="throttling">Throttling</h2>
    <p>
      The solutions weâ€™ve seen so far are great to stop abusive queries from
      taking your servers down. The problem with using them alone like this is
      that they will stop large queries, but wonâ€™t stop clients that are making
      a lot of medium sized queries!
    </p>
    <p>
      In most APIs, a simple throttle is used to stop clients from requesting
      resources too often. GraphQL is a bit special because throttling on the
      number of requests does not really help us. Even a few queries might be
      too much if they are very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, we have no idea what amount of requests is acceptable since they
      are defined by the clients. So what can we use to throttle clients?
    </p>
    <h3 id="throttling-based-on-server-time">
      Throttling Based on Server Time
    </h3>
    <p>
      A good estimate of how expensive a query is the server time it needs to
      complete. We can use this heuristic to throttle queries. With a good
      knowledge of your system, you can come up with a maximum server time a
      client can use over a certain time frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also decide on how much server time is added to a client over time.
      This is a classic
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket"
        >leaky bucket algorithm</a
      >. Note that there are other throttling algorithms out there, but they are
      out of scope for this chapter. We will use a leaky bucket throttle in the
      next examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letâ€™s imagine our maximum server time (Bucket Size) allowed is set to
      <code>1000ms</code>, that clients gain <code>100ms</code> of server time
      per second (Leak Rate) and this mutation:
    </p>
    <pre class="graphql"><code>mutation {
  createPost(input: { title: &quot;GraphQL Security&quot; }) {
    post {
      title
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      takes on average <code>200ms</code> to complete. In reality, the time may
      vary but weâ€™ll assume it always takes <code>200ms</code> to complete for
      the sake of this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      It means that a client calling this operation more than 5 times within 1
      second would be blocked until more available server time is added to the
      client.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two seconds (<code>100ms</code> is added by second), our client
      could call the <code>createPost</code> a single time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, throttling based on time is a great way to throttle
      GraphQL queries since complex queries will end up consuming more time
      meaning you can call them less often, and smaller queries may be called
      more often since they will be very fast to compute.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be good to express these throttling constraints to clients if your
      GraphQL API is public. In that case, server time is not always the easiest
      thing to express to clients, and clients cannot really estimate what time
      their queries will take without trying them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember the Max Complexity we talked about earlier? What if we throttled
      based on that instead?
    </p>
    <h3 id="throttling-based-on-query-complexity">
      Throttling Based on Query Complexity
    </h3>
    <p>
      Throttling based on Query Complexity is a great way to work with clients
      and help them respect the limits of your schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letâ€™s use the same complexity example we used in the Query Complexity
      section:
    </p>
    <pre class="graphql"><code>query {
  author(id: &quot;abc&quot;) {    # complexity: 1
    posts {              # complexity: 1
      title              # complexity: 1
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      We know that this query has a cost <code>3</code> based on complexity.
      Just like a time throttle, we can come up with a maximum cost (Bucket
      Size) per time a client can use.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a maximum cost of <code>9</code>, our clients could run this query
      only three times, before the leak rate forbids them to query more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principles are the same as our time throttle, but now communicating
      these limits to clients is much nicer. Clients can even calculate the
      costs of their queries themselves without needing to estimate server time!
    </p>
    <p>
      The GitHub public API actually uses this approach to throttle their
      clients. Take a look at how they express these limits to users:
      https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/resource-limitations/.
    </p>
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      GraphQL is great to use for clients because it gives them so much more
      power. But that power also gives them the possibility to abuse your
      GraphQL server with very expensive queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many approaches to secure your GraphQL server against these
      queries, but none of them is bullet proof. Itâ€™s important to know what
      options are available and know their limits so we take the best decisions!
