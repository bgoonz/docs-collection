      Over the past decade,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"
        >REST</a
      >
      has become the standard (yet a fuzzy one) for designing web APIs. It
      offers some great ideas, such as <em>stateless servers</em> and
      <em>structured access to resources</em>. However, REST APIs have shown to
      be too inflexible to keep up with the rapidly changing requirements of the
      clients that access them.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL was developed to cope with the need for more flexibility and
      efficiency! It solves many of the shortcomings and inefficiencies that
      developers experience when interacting with REST APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate the major differences between REST and GraphQL when it comes
      to fetching data from an API, let’s consider a simple example scenario: In
      a blogging application, an app needs to display the titles of the posts of
      a specific user. The same screen also displays the names of the last 3
      followers of that user. How would that situation be solved with REST and
      GraphQL?

      Data Fetching with REST vs GraphQL
    </h3>
    <p>
      With a REST API, you would typically gather the data by accessing multiple
      endpoints. In the example, these could be
      <code>/users/&lt;id&gt;</code> endpoint to fetch the initial user data.
      Secondly, there’s likely to be a
      <code>/users/&lt;id&gt;/posts</code> endpoint that returns all the posts
      for a user. The third endpoint will then be the
      <code>/users/&lt;id&gt;/followers</code> that returns a list of followers
      per user.
    </p>

        >With REST, you have to make three requests to different endpoints to

        endpoints return additional information that’s not needed.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In GraphQL on the other hand, you’d simply send a single query to the
      GraphQL server that includes the concrete data requirements. The server
      then responds with a JSON object where these requirements are fulfilled.

      No more Over- and Underfetching
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the most common problems with REST is that of over- and
      underfetching. This happens because the only way for a client to download
      data is by hitting endpoints that return <em>fixed</em> data structures.
      It’s very difficult to design the API in a way that it’s able to provide
      clients with their exact data needs.

    <h4 id="overfetching-downloading-superfluous-data">
      Overfetching: Downloading superfluous data
    </h4>
    <p>
      <em>Overfetching</em> means that a client downloads more information than
      is actually required in the app. Imagine for example a screen that needs
      to display a list of users only with their names. In a REST API, this app
      would usually hit the <code>/users</code> endpoint and receive a JSON
      array with user data. This response however might contain more info about
      the users that are returned, e.g. their birthdays or addresses -
      information that is useless for the client because it only needs to
      display the users’ names.
    </p>
    <h4 id="underfetching-and-the-n1-problem">
      Underfetching and the n+1 problem
    </h4>
    <p>
      Another issue is <em>underfetching</em> and the <em>n+1</em>-requests
      problem. Underfetching generally means that a specific endpoint doesn’t
      provide enough of the required information. The client will have to make
      additional requests to fetch everything it needs. This can escalate to a
      situation where a client needs to first download a list of elements, but
      then needs to make one additional request per element to fetch the
      required data.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, consider the same app would also need to display the last
      three followers per user. The API provides the additional endpoint
      <code>/users/&lt;user-id&gt;/followers</code>. In order to be able to
      display the required information, the app will have to make one request to
      the <code>/users</code> endpoint and then hit the
      <code>/users/&lt;user-id&gt;/followers</code> endpoint for
      <em>each</em> user.
    </p>
    <h3 id="rapid-product-iterations-on-the-frontend">
      Rapid Product Iterations on the Frontend
    </h3>
    <p>
      A common pattern with REST APIs is to structure the endpoints according to
      the views that you have inside your app. This is handy since it allows for
      the client to get all required information for a particular view by simply
      accessing the corresponding endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major drawback of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for rapid
      iterations on the frontend. With every change that is made to the UI,
      there is a high risk that now there is more (or less) data required than
      before. Consequently, the backend needs to be adjusted as well to account
      for the new data needs. This kills productivity and notably slows down the
      ability to incorporate user feedback into a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      With GraphQL, this problem is solved. Thanks to the flexible nature of
      GraphQL, changes on the client-side can be made without any extra work on
      the server. Since clients can specify their exact data requirements, no
      backend engineer needs to make adjustments when the design and data needs
      on the frontend change.
    </p>
    <h3 id="insightful-analytics-on-the-backend">
      Insightful Analytics on the Backend
    </h3>
    <p>
      GraphQL allows you to have fine-grained insights about the data that’s
      requested on the backend. As each client specifies exactly what
      information it’s interested in, it is possible to gain a deep
      understanding of how the available data is being used. This can for
      example help in evolving an API and deprecating specific fields that are
      not requested by any clients any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      With GraphQL, you can also do low-level performance monitoring of the
      requests that are processed by your server. GraphQL uses the concept of
      <em>resolver functions</em> to collect the data that’s requested by a
      client. Instrumenting and measuring performance of these resolvers
      provides crucial insights about bottlenecks in your system.
    </p>
    <h3 id="benefits-of-a-schema-type-system">
      Benefits of a Schema &amp; Type System
    </h3>
    <p>
      GraphQL uses a strong type system to define the capabilities of an API.
      All the types that are exposed in an API are written down in a
      <em>schema</em> using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). This
      schema serves as the contract between the client and the server to define
      how a client can access the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the schema is defined, the teams working on frontend and backends can
      do their work without further communication since they both are aware of
      the definite structure of the data that’s sent over the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frontend teams can easily test their applications by mocking the required
      data structures. Once the server is ready, the switch can be flipped for
      the client apps to load the data from the actual API.
