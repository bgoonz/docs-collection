      provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. It

        APIs have become ubiquitous components of software infrastructures. In
        short, an <strong>API</strong> defines how a <strong>client</strong> can
        load data from a <strong>server</strong>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At its core, GraphQL enables <em>declarative data fetching</em> where a
      client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of
      multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server
      only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a
      client asked for.

      GraphQL - A Query Language for APIs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most applications today have the need to fetch data from a server where
      that data is stored in a database. Itâ€™s the responsibility of the API to
      provide an interface to the stored data that fits an applicationâ€™s needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL is often confused with being a database technology. This is a
      misconception, GraphQL is a <em>query language</em> for APIs - not
      databases. In that sense itâ€™s database agnostic and effectively can be
      used in any context where an API is used.

      has been a popular way to expose data from a server. When the concept of
      REST was developed, client applications were relatively simple and the
      development pace wasnâ€™t nearly where it is today. REST thus was a good fit
      for many applications. However, the API landscape has radically changed
      over the last couple of years. In particular, there are three factors that
      have been challenging the way APIs are designed:
    </p>
    <h5 id="increased-mobile-usage-creates-need-for-efficient-data-loading">
      1. Increased mobile usage creates need for efficient data loading
    </h5>
    <p>
      Increased mobile usage, low-powered devices and sloppy networks were the
      initial reasons why Facebook developed GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the
      amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus
      majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.
    </p>
    <h5 id="variety-of-different-frontend-frameworks-and-platforms">
      2. Variety of different frontend frameworks and platforms
    </h5>
    <p>
      The heterogeneous landscape of frontend frameworks and platforms that run
      client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that
      would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access
      precisely the data it needs.

      3. Fast development &amp; expectation for rapid feature development
    </h5>
    <p>
      Continuous deployment has become a standard for many companies, rapid
      iterations and frequent product updates are indispensable. With REST APIs,
      the way data is exposed by the server often needs to be modified to
      account for specific requirements and design changes on the client-side.
      This hinders fast development practices and product iterations.

      GraphQL is <em>not</em> only for React Developers
    </h4>
    <p>
      Facebook started using GraphQL in 2012 in their native mobile apps.
      Interestingly though, GraphQL has mostly been picked up to be used in the
      context of web technologies and has gained only little traction in the
      native mobile space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time Facebook publicly spoke about GraphQL was at
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sc8Pyc51uU"
        >React.js Conf 2015</a
      >
      and shortly after announced their
      <a
        href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html"
        >plans to open source</a
      >
      it. Because Facebook always used to speak about GraphQL in the context of
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, it took a while for
      non-React developers to understand that GraphQL was by no means a
      technology that was limited to usage with React.

      In fact, GraphQL is a technology that can be used everywhere a client
      communicates with an API. Interestingly, other companies like
      <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog">Netflix</a> or
      <a href="https://building.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> were working on
      comparable ideas to make API interactions more efficient. Coursera
      envisioned a similar technology to let a client specify its data
      requirements and Netflix even open-sourced their solution called
      <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a>. After GraphQL was
      open-sourced, Coursera completely cancelled their own efforts and hopped
      on the GraphQL train.

    <p>
      Today, GraphQL is used in production by
      <a href="http://graphql.org/users/">lots of different companies</a> such
      as GitHub, Twitter, Yelp and Shopify - to name only a few.
