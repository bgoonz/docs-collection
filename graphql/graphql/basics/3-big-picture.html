      GraphQL has been released only as a <em>specification</em>. This means
      that GraphQL is in fact not more than a
      <a href="https://graphql.org/">long document</a> that describes in detail
      the behaviour of a <em>GraphQL server.</em>
    </p>
    <h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
      In this section, we’ll walk you through 3 different kinds of architectures
      that include a GraphQL server:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>GraphQL server <em>with a connected database</em></li>
      <li>
        GraphQL server that is a
        <em
          >thin layer in front of a number of third party or legacy systems</em
        >
        and integrates them through a single GraphQL API
      </li>
      <li>
        A
        <em
          >hybrid approach of a connected database and third party or legacy
          systems</em
        >
        that can all be accessed through the same GraphQL API
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All three architectures represent major use cases of GraphQL and
      demonstrate the flexibility in terms of the context where it can be used.
    </p>
    <h4 id="graphql-server-with-a-connected-database">
      1. GraphQL server with a connected database
    </h4>
    <p>
      This architecture will be the most common for
      <em>greenfield</em> projects. In the setup, you have a single (web) server
      that implements the GraphQL specification. When a query arrives at the
      GraphQL server, the server reads the query’s payload and fetches the
      required information from the database. This is called
      <em>resolving</em> the query. It then constructs the response object
      <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Response"
        >as described in the official specification</a
      >
      and returns it to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that GraphQL is actually
      <em>transport-layer agnostic</em>. This means it can potentially be used
      with any available network protocol. So, it is potentially possible to
      implement a GraphQL server based on TCP, WebSockets, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL also doesn’t care about the database or the format that is used to
      store the data. You could use a SQL database like
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora">AWS Aurora</a> or a NoSQL
      database like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.
    </p>

      <em
        >A standard greenfield architecture with one GraphQL server that
        connects to a single database.</em
      >
    </p>
    <h4 id="graphql-layer-that-integrates-existing-systems">
      2. GraphQL layer that integrates existing systems
    </h4>
    <p>
      Another major use case for GraphQL is the integration of multiple existing
      systems behind a single, coherent GraphQL API. This is particularly
      compelling for companies with legacy infrastructures and many different
      APIs that have grown over years and now impose a high maintenance burden.
      One major problem with these legacy systems is that they make it
      practically impossible to build innovative products that need access to
      multiple systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that context, GraphQL can be used to <em>unify</em> these existing
      systems and hide their complexity behind a nice GraphQL API. This way, new
      client applications can be developed that simply talk to the GraphQL
      server to fetch the data they need. The GraphQL server is then responsible
      for fetching the data from the existing systems and package it up in the
      GraphQL response format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like in the previous architecture where the GraphQL server didn’t
      care about the type of database being used, this time it doesn’t care
      about the data sources that it needs to fetch the data that’s needed to
      <em>resolve</em> a query.
    </p>

      <em
        >GraphQL allows you to hide the complexity of existing systems, such as
        microservices, legacy infrastructures or third-party APIs behind a
        single GraphQL interface.</em
      >
    </p>
    <h4

    >
      3. Hybrid approach with connected database and integration of existing
      system
    </h4>
    <p>
      Finally, it’s possible to combine the two approaches and build a GraphQL
      server that has a connected database but still talks to legacy or
      third—party systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a query is received by the server, it will resolve it and either
      retrieve the required data from the connected database or some of the
      integrated APIs.
    </p>
    <p>

        alt="Hybrid approach with connected database and integration of existing system"
      />
      <em
        >Both approaches can also be combined and the GraphQL server can fetch
        data from a single database as well as from an existing system -
        allowing for complete flexibility and pushing all data management
        complexity to the server.</em

    <h3 id="resolver-functions">Resolver Functions</h3>
    <p>
      But how do we gain this flexibility with GraphQL? How is it that it’s such
      a great fit for these very different kinds of use cases?
    </p>
    <p>
      As you learned in the previous chapter, the payload of a GraphQL query (or
      mutation) consists of a set of <em>fields</em>. In the GraphQL server
      implementation, each of these fields actually corresponds to exactly one
      function that’s called a
      <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers"
        ><em>resolver</em></a
      >. The sole purpose of a resolver function is to fetch the data for its
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the server receives a query, it will call all the functions for the
      fields that are specified in the query’s payload. It thus
      <em>resolves</em> the query and is able to retrieve the correct data for
      each field. Once all resolvers returned, the server will package data up
      in the format that was described by the query and send it back to the
      client.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://imgur.com/e1gBEP5.png"
        alt="Screenshot containing some of the resolved field names"
      />
      <em
        >The above screenshot contains some of the resolved field names. Each
        field in the query corresponds to a
        <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers"
          >resolver function</a
        >. The GraphQL calls all required resolvers when a query comes in to
        fetch the specified data.</em
      >
    </p>
    <h3 id="graphql-client-libraries">GraphQL Client Libraries</h3>
    <p>
      GraphQL is particularly great for frontend developers since it completely
      eliminates many of the inconveniences and shortcomings that are
      experienced with REST APIs, such as over- and underfetching. Complexity is
      pushed to the server-side where powerful machines can take care of the
      heavy computation work. The client doesn’t have to know where the data
      that it fetches is actually coming from and can use a single, coherent and
      flexible API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s consider the major change that’s introduced with GraphQL in going
      from a rather imperative data fetching approach to a purely declarative
      one. When fetching data from a REST API, most applications will have to go
      through the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        construct and send HTTP request (e.g. with <code>fetch</code> in
        Javascript)
      </li>
      <li>receive and parse server response</li>
      <li>store data locally (either simply in memory or persistent)</li>
      <li>display data in the UI</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      With the ideal <em>declarative data fetching</em> approach, a client
      shouldn’t be doing more than the following two steps:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>describe data requirements</li>
      <li>display data in UI</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All the lower-level networking tasks as well as storing the data should be
      abstracted away and the declaration of data dependencies should be the
      dominant part.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is precisely what GraphQL client libraries like Relay or Apollo will
      enable you to do. They provide the abstraction that you need to be able to
      focus on the important parts of your application rather than having to
      deal with the repetitive implementation of infrastructure.
