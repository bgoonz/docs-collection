In this tutorial you learned how to handle [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) in a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) project via [GraphQL Ruby gem](http://graphql-ruby.org/).

We covered:

- defining a GraphQL schema
- connecting types
- manipulating data via GraphQL mutation
- handling complex querying

In https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-ruby you can find the final project + a couple of further improvements ðŸ˜º.
