<p>Congratulations, you’ve reached the end of the Python GraphQL tutorial! Here, you’ve learned about the most used Python library for developing a GraphQL server – <a href="http://graphene-python.org/">Graphene</a> – together with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/">Graphene-Django</a>.</p>
<p>Implementing a Hackernews clone, you were able to go from a simple query to creating an awesome Relay structure. As you noticed, GraphQL is changing how clients and servers communicate and exchange data. Even being a young technology, it is already being adopted by big players, such as <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">GitHub</a>.</p>
