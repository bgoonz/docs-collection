      <a href="https://golang.org/"><strong>Go</strong></a> is a modern general
      purpose programming language designed by google; best known for it’s
      simplicity, concurrency and fast performance. It’s being used by big
      players in the industry like Google, Docker, Lyft and Uber. If you are new
      to golang you can start from
      <a href="https://tour.golang.org/">golang tour</a> to learn fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://gqlgen.com/"><strong>gqlgen</strong></a> is a library for
      creating GraphQL applications in Go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this tutorial we Implement a Hackernews GraphQL API clone with
      <em>golang</em> and <em>gqlgen</em> and learn about GraphQL fundamentals
      along the way. Source code and also this tutorial are available on Github
      at: https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-golang

      What is a GraphQL server? <a name="what-is-a-graphql-server"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A GraphQL server is able to receive requests in GraphQL Query Language
      format and return response in desired form. GraphQL is a query language
      for API so you can send queries and ask for what you need and exactly get
      that piece of data. In this sample query we are looking for address, title
      of the links and name of the user who add it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>query {
    links{
        title
        address,
        user{
            name
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>response:</p>
    <pre><code>{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;links&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;our dummy link&quot;,
        &quot;address&quot;: &quot;https://address.org&quot;,
        &quot;user&quot;: {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}</code></pre>

      Schema-Driven Development <a name="schema-driven-development"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In GraphQL your API starts with a schema that defines all your types,
      queries and mutations, It helps others to understand your API. So it’s
      like a contract between server and the client. Whenever you need to add a
      new capability to a GraphQL API you must redefine schema file and then
      implement that part in your code. GraphQL has its
      <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/schema/">Schema Definition Language</a>
      for this purpose. gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL servers and
      has a nice feature that generates code based on your schema definition.
