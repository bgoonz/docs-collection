      Scala is a very popular language nowadays and it’s often chosen to deliver
      efficient and scalable systems. It leverages the Java VM, known for its
      reliability and robustness. Support for Functional Programming, rich
      ecosystem and stable foundation allow building fast applications, quickly.

    <h3 id="what-is-a-graphql-server">What is a GraphQL Server?</h3>
    <p>A GraphQL server should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receive requests following the GraphQL format, for example:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre
      class="graphql(nocopy)"
    ><code>{  &quot;query&quot;: &quot;query { allLinks { url } }&quot; }</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Connect to one or more data sources, like databases or other APIs and
        format obtained information.
      </li>
      <li>Response with the requested data, such as this one:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre
      class="graphql(nocopy)"
    ><code>{ &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;allLinks&quot;: { &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://graphql.org/&quot; } } }</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Validate incoming requests accordingly to the schema definition and
        supported formats. For example, if a query is made with an unknown
        field, the response should be something like:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="graphql(nocopy)"><code>{
  &quot;errors&quot;: [{
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Cannot query field \&quot;unknown\&quot; on type \&quot;Link\&quot;.&quot;
  }]
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see our server will be really simple, but real GraphQL
      implementation can do much more than this. (We will explore it more later
      on.)
    </p>
    <h3 id="schema-driven-development">Schema-Driven Development</h3>
    <p>
      Schema-first GraphQL development forces frontend and backend developers to
      agree on a strict contract up front, enabling them to work quickly and
      efficiently while staying on spec. It improves both your API’s performance
      and the performance of your team in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensibly then, the experience of building a GraphQL server starts with
      working on its schema. You’ll see in this chapter that the main steps you
      follow will be something like this:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Define your types and the appropriate queries and mutations for them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement functions (called <strong>resolvers</strong>) to perform
        agreed upon queries in terms of defined types.
      </li>
      <li>
        As new requirements arrive, go back to step 1 to update the schema and
        go through the other steps.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The schema is a contract between the frontend and backend, so keeping it
      at the center allows both sides of the development to evolve without going
      off the spec. This also makes it easier to parallelize the work. Since the
      frontend can move on with full knowledge of the API from the start, using
      a simple mocking service (or even a full backend such as Graphcool) which
      can later be easily replaced with the final server.
    </p>
    <h3 id="goal-of-the-tutorial">Goal of the tutorial</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the HowToGraphQL tutorials are based on the same schema. In our
      tutorial we will try to run scala server which supports that schema. In
      this case you can take any frontend example and connect it to our server.
      The schema more or less looks like this:
    </p>
