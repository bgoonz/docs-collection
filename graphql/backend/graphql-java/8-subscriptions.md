As you learned in the intro tutorial, GraphQL specification defines a mechanism for real-time push-style updates, called *subscriptions*. While `graphql-java` does parse subscription requests, [its support at the moment](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/358) unfortunately stops there, and thus isnâ€™t very useful without significant manual effort that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Expect an update to this chapter as soon as the situation changes.
