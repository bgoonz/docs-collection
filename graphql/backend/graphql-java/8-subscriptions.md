As you learned in the intro tutorial, GraphQL specification defines a mechanism for real-time push-style updates, called _subscriptions_. While `graphql-java` does parse subscription requests, [its support at the moment](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/358) unfortunately stops there, and thus isn’t very useful without significant manual effort that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Expect an update to this chapter as soon as the situation changes.
