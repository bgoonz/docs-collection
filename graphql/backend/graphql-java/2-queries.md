### Query resolvers

To maintain strong typing and intuitive design, it is common to represent GraphQL types with equivalent Java classes, and fields with methods. graphql-java-tools defines two types of classes: _data classes_, which model the domain and are usually simple POJOs, and _resolvers_, that model the queries and mutations and contain the resolver functions. Often, both are needed to model a single GraphQL type.

The schema so far looks like this:

    type Link {
      url: String!
      description: String!
    }

    type Query {
      allLinks: [Link]
    }

    schema {
      query: Query
    }

To model it, two classes are needed: `Link` and `Query`.

`Link` is a POJO (containing no behavior), so create it as follows:

    public class Link {

        private final String url;
        private final String description;

        public Link(String url, String description) {
            this.url = url;
            this.description = description;
        }

        public String getUrl() {
            return url;
        }

        public String getDescription() {
            return description;
        }
    }

You should also create a `LinkRepository` class that will neatly isolate the concern of saving and loading links from the storage. This also makes future extensions and refactoring a lot easier. For now, the links will only be kept in memory.

Create `LinkRepository` as follows

    public class LinkRepository {

        private final List<Link> links;

        public LinkRepository() {
            links = new ArrayList<>();
            //add some links to start off with
            links.add(new Link("http://howtographql.com", "Your favorite GraphQL page"));
            links.add(new Link("http://graphql.org/learn/", "The official docks"));
        }

        public List<Link> getAllLinks() {
            return links;
        }

        public void saveLink(Link link) {
            links.add(link);
        }
    }

### Returning links

Unlike the `Link` POJO, `Query` models behavior, as it contains the resolver for the `allLinks` query.

Create it as such:

    public class Query implements GraphQLRootResolver {

        private final LinkRepository linkRepository;

        public Query(LinkRepository linkRepository) {
            this.linkRepository = linkRepository;
        }

        public List<Link> allLinks() {
            return linkRepository.getAllLinks();
        }
    }

Finally, you can update `GraphQLEndpoint` to register the resolver properly when generating the schema:

    @WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/graphql")
    public class GraphQLEndpoint extends SimpleGraphQLServlet {

        public GraphQLEndpoint() {
            super(buildSchema());
        }

        private static GraphQLSchema buildSchema() {
            LinkRepository linkRepository = new LinkRepository();
            return SchemaParser.newParser()
                    .file("schema.graphqls")
                    .resolvers(new Query(linkRepository))
                    .build()
                    .makeExecutableSchema();
        }
    }

Notice how the schema-building logic got extracted into a separate method for easier future additions.

If you now open http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={allLinks{url}} youâ€™ll see your very first GraphQL query executing and giving you the result looking like this:

    {
      "data": {
        "allLinks": [
          {
            "url": "http://howtographql.com"
          },
          {
            "url": "http://graphql.org/learn/"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

It is now appropriate to feel good about yourself ðŸ˜Ž

### Testing with GraphiQL

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is an in-browser IDE allowing you to explore the schema, fire queries/mutations and see the results.

To add GraphiQL, copy [the example `index.html` from GraphiQLâ€™s GitHub repo](https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-java/blob/master/src/main/webapp/index.html) and replace the paths to `graphiql.css` and `graphiql.js` from

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/graphiql/graphiql.css" />
    <script src="./node_modules/graphiql/graphiql.js"></script>

to

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/graphiql@0.11.2/graphiql.css" />
    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/graphiql@0.11.2/graphiql.js"></script>

Save the file to `src/main/webapp/index.html` (you may as well delete `index.jsp` that Maven generated), start Jetty and open http://localhost:8080/, and you should be greeted by a cool looking environment where you can test what youâ€™ve build so far.

If you type the same query from above into the left panel (notice the auto-completion!), you should get the same result but nicely formatted this time. You can also click [this link](http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=%7BallLinks%7Burl%7D%7D).

Keep using GraphiQL to test out queries and mutation as you follow the tutorial.
