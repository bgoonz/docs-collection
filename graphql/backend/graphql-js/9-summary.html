      In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch.
      The stack you used was based on
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>,
      <a
        href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server"
        ><code>apollo-server</code></a
      >
      and <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>apollo-server</code> is a fast and simple GraphQL server library
      built on top of <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>. It comes
      with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for
      <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground"
        >GraphQL Playgrounds</a
      >
      and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using Prisma Client
      which is responsible for database access.
    </p>
