      GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. It replaces REST as an
      API design paradigm and is becoming the new standard for exposing the data
      and functionality of a web server.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to build an <em>idiomatic</em> GraphQL
      server entirely from scratch. You are going to use the following
      technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server"
          >Apollo Server 2.18</a
        >: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance
        and great developer experience,
        <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js"
          ><code>graphql-js</code></a
        >
        and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>: Replaces traditional ORMs.
        Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of GraphQL resolvers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground"
          >GraphQL Playground</a
        >: A ‚ÄúGraphQL IDE‚Äù that allows you to interactively explore the
        functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it.
        It‚Äôs somewhat similar to
        <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> which offers
        comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, GraphQL
        Playground:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Auto-generates comprehensive documentation for all available API
            operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations &amp;
            subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax highlighting.
          </li>
          <li>Lets you easily share your API operations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this tutorial is to build an API for a
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> clone. Here is a
      quick rundown of what to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      You‚Äôll start by learning the basics of how a GraphQL server works, simply
      by defining a
      <a
        href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e"
        ><em>GraphQL schema</em></a
      >
      for the server and writing corresponding <em>resolver functions</em>. In
      the beginning, these resolvers will only work with data that‚Äôs stored
      in-memory - so nothing will persist beyond the runtime of the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody wants a server that‚Äôs not able to store and persist data, right?
      Not to worry! Next, you‚Äôre going to add a
      <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database to the project which will
      be managed with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have the database connected, you are going to add more advanced
      features to the API.
    </p>
    <p>
      You‚Äôll start by implementing signup/login functionality that enables users
      to authenticate against the API. This will also allow you to check the
      permissions of your users for certain API operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, you‚Äôll allow the consumers of the API to constrain the list of items
      they retrieve from the API by adding filtering and pagination capabalities
      to it.
