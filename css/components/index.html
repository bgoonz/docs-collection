      Components make it easier to mark up a set of elements that are commonly
      grouped together with similar visual styles. Their base styles are shared
      and variants are added with modifier classes, so usually components are
      comprised of multiple classes. Most importantly, components should be
      highly reusable across the site, rather than built for specific pages or
      features. To achieve this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Separate structure and skin:</strong> This means to define
        repeating visual features (like background and border styles) as
        separate “skins” that you can mix-and-match with your various components
        to achieve a large amount of visual variety without much code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Separate container and content:</strong> Essentially, this means
        “rarely use location-dependent styles”. A component should look the same
        no matter where you put it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
