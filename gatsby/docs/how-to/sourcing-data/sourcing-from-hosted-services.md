title: Sourcing from Hosted Services
---

There are many Gatsby plugins that integrate with hosted cloud services, also known as SaaS (Software as a Service). You can search for [Gatsby plugins](/plugins/) as well as [Gatsby starters](/starters/) that integrate with hosted services to source content and functionality. Some examples include:

- [Airtable](/plugins/gatsby-source-airtable)
- [AWS DynamoDB](/plugins/gatsby-source-dynamodb)
- [Contentful](/plugins/gatsby-source-contentful/)
- [Firebase](/plugins/gatsby-source-firebase)
- [Google Docs](/plugins/gatsby-source-google-docs)
- [Prismic](/plugins/gatsby-source-prismic-graphql)
- [Shopify](/plugins/gatsby-source-shopify)

These plugins will pull data from a hosted service and make it available to your Gatsby site via GraphQL.

More examples are described on the Gatsby blog:

- [Google Sheets](/blog/2019-07-23-google-sheets-gatsby-acroyoga-video-explorer/)

You can also [write your own source plugin](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/creating-a-source-plugin/) to integrate with a service that isn't already represented.
