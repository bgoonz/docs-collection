title: Adding Analytics

## Why use analytics?

Most professional website teams using Gatsby use one of three types of analytics services on their website:

- **Google Analytics** because the functionality is free and comprehensive.
- **Third-party marketing analytics** like marketing automation (Hubspot, Marketo), session recording (FullStory, Heap), or hundreds of smaller vendors
- **Google Tag Manager** or **Segment** in order to easily send data to these third-party services, or collect data with third-party scripts

Gatsby offers a plugin for most common services, making first-class integration of analytics a simple, speedy, and secure process.

When utilizing marketing analytics tools, one key tradeoff is that marketing analytics tools are often the culprit for poor website performance. As a result, tools that make it easier for marketers to add and remove analytics (via Google Tag Manager), can also make it easier for them to harm site performance without noticing.
