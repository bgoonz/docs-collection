title: Deploying to Gatsby Cloud
---

While there are a number of different ways to build and deploy Gatsby sites, we recommend [Gatsby Cloud](/products/cloud/). Gatsby Cloud is built by the Gatsby team to be the fastest way to build and host your website.

Some features include:

- Quick Connect to automatically set up webhooks with your CMS
- [Preview](/products/cloud/previews/) to simplify content creation and collaboration by providing a shareable temporary URL for viewing changes immediately and in context.
- Automated Lighthouse performance checks and deploy previews to fix errors before theyâ€™re published.
- A [free tier](/pricing/) designed to comfortably support personal and small sites.

## Integrations

Gatsby Cloud integrates with the tools you already use to build sites. By connecting your Gatsby project's GitHub repo, Gatsby Cloud automatically builds and deploys your site when you make changes.

You can [sign up for Gatsby Cloud here](/dashboard/signup/).
