title: Building an E-commerce Site
---

The speed and performance of sites built with Gatsby make it a great tool for building e-commerce sites. There are existing plugins for connecting services like [Shopify](/plugins/gatsby-source-shopify/) and [Snipcart](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-snipcart/) to Gatsby, and this section contains reference guides to help get things setup.

To see examples of e-commerce sites built with Gatsby, check out the [showcase](/showcase/?filters%5B0%5D=E-commerce).
