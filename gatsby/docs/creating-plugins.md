title: Creating Plugins
---

You may be looking to build and perhaps publish a plugin that doesn't exist yet, or you may just be curious to know more about the anatomy of a Gatsby plugin (file structure, etc).

## Core concepts

- Each Gatsby plugin can be created as an npm package or as a [local plugin](/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/)
- A `package.json` is required
- Plugins implement the Gatsby APIs for [Node](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/), [server-side rendering](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/), and the [browser](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/)

This section of the docs includes the following guides:
