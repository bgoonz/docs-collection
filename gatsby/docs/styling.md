There are many ways to style your website. They can roughly be grouped into three styling approaches:

- [**Global CSS Files**](/docs/how-to/styling/global-css/): the traditional way to style a website. CSS rules are declared globally and styles are applied depending on specificity and inheritance.
- [**Modular Stylesheets**](/docs/how-to/styling/css-modules): CSS rules are written traditionally but consumed with JavaScript and scoped locally to avoid unintended side effects elsewhere. Works out-of-the-box with Gatsby.
- [**CSS-in-JS**](/docs/how-to/styling/css-in-js/): locally-scoped CSS written and consumed in JavaScript, enabling the easier use of dynamic styling and other features. Requires the use of third-party libraries.

Gatsby doesn't have an opinion about which styling approach you choose. Almost every possible option is supported through official and community plugins. _(If there isnâ€™t a plugin yet for your favorite option, consider [contributing](/docs/creating-plugins) one!)_
