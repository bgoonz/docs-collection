title: Deploying and Hosting
---

Getting your shiny new Gatsby site deployed and accessible is probably the first thing you will want to do now that it's built! Also, give yourself a pat on the back real quick for creating something so great!

When you build your Gatsby application, the output is static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. This content is incredibly easy and affordable to host with any provider. We have several guides below for hosting with particular providers, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Whether you're deploying to AWS, Netlify, or something else entirely switching to static content makes deploying a trivial concern.

  Many of the integrations below, like Netlify and Vercel, are supported on
  Gatsby Cloud, the best way to deploy Gatsby sites. Reports give you visibility
  into the performance and SEO of your site, and Gatsby Cloud has a
  special-built architecture that builds your site 20 times faster, often under
  10 seconds.

The Gatsby blog also has posts on both [deployment](/blog/tags/deployment/) and [hosting](/blog/tags/hosting/).
