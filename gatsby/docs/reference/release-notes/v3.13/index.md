## Improved Changelogs

While the release notes (like the one you're reading right now) are hand-written and manually published, the changelog of each package we publish has been autogenerated by `lerna` in the past and unfortunately the generated output wasn't ideal for users to consume. We know that developers love detailed and accurate changelogs so we decided to replace `lerna` behavior with our own tooling. In [PR #32884](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32886) we added these functionalities and the results are much better.

Take [`gatsby-plugin-image` changelog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-image/CHANGELOG.md) as an example:

- Each semver release is its own heading (+ the date it was released)
- If applicable the general release notes are linked
- The PRs are categorized into features, bug fixes, chores, and other

## `sharp` v0.29

As always, thanks to [lovell](https://github.com/lovell) for maintaining `sharp` and sending in the [PR #32851](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32851) to update `sharp` (see [`sharp` v0.29 changelog](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/changelog#v0290---17th-august-2021)) and our image plugins. `gatsby-plugin-sharp` now no longer uses `imagemin` but native `sharp` methods.

You'll get these benefits by upgrading:

- Reduced JPEG, PNG, and AVIF encoding time by up to 50%
- Reduced Gatsby install size/time by ~10% (~19MB smaller on filesystem)
- Improved AVIF image quality and will also work with Chrome 93+

## Faster Sourcing for `gatsby-source-drupal`

You now can significantly speed up sourcing from your Drupal instance if you install [JSON:API Extras](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi_extras) and enable "Include count in collection queries" (`/admin/config/services/jsonapi/extras`). The [PR #32883](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/32883) leverages that information to enable parallel API requests.

For a test site with ~3200 entities and a warm Drupal cache (and no CDN cache), this change dropped sourcing time from 14s to 4s. On a very large production Drupal site (~600k entities), fetching time for a cold build dropped from 2 hours to 30 minutes ðŸš€.

## webpack Caching in Development for Everyone

After ramping up the opt-in of this feature to 20% in [v3.12](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.12/#ramping-up-support-for-webpack-caching-in-development) we're now enabling this feature for everyone! So webpack 5 built-in persistent caching is now enabled for everyone both in development and production. It allows webpack to reuse results of previous compilations and significantly speed up those steps.
