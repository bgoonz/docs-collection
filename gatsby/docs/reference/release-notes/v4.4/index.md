## Detect Node Mutations

In Gatsby 4 [LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/) became the default data store. It allows Gatsby to execute data layer related processing outside of the main build process and enables Gatsby to run queries in multiple processes as well as support additional rendering strategies ([DSG](/docs/reference/rendering-options/deferred-static-generation/) and [SSR](/docs/reference/rendering-options/server-side-rendering/)).

In a lot of cases that change is completely invisible to users, but if you're a source plugin author or have your own custom source plugin you might be affected by this.

Direct node mutations in various API lifecycles are not persisted anymore. In previous Gatsby versions it did work because source of truth for the data layer was directly in Node.js memory, so mutating node was in fact mutating source of truth. Common errors when doing swap to `LMDB` will be that some fields don't exist anymore or are `null`/`undefined` when trying to execute GraphQL queries.

With this release you're now able to detect node mutations and debug the aforementioned cases of `null`/`undefined`. Learn more about this at [Debugging Missing or Stale Data Fields on Nodes](/docs/how-to/local-development/debugging-missing-data/).
