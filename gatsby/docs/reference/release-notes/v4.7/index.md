## `trailingSlash` Option

_Currently in Public Beta_

Through the RFC [Integrated handling of trailing slashes in Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34205) we've worked on making the trailing slashes feature a first-class citizen in Gatsby. We're happy to announce that `gatsby-config` now supports a `trailingSlash` configuration with these three main options:

- `always`: Always add trailing slashes to each URL, e.g. `/x` to `/x/`.
- `never`: Remove all trailing slashes on each URL, e.g. `/x/` to `/x`.
- `ignore`: Don't automatically modify the URL

You can set it like this:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: "always"
}
```

Throughout Gatsby 4 the default setting for `trailingSlash` will be `legacy` (to keep the current behavior) but with Gatsby 5 we'll remove the `legacy` setting and make `always` the default. Please note that these plugins are considered deprecated now: [gatsby-plugin-force-trailing-slashes](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-force-trailing-slashes/) and [gatsby-plugin-remove-trailing-slashes](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-remove-trailing-slashes/).

Gatsby Cloud supports this new setting out of the box and also uses `301` redirects to bring visitors to the right location. Locally you can use `gatsby serve` to see the behavior. Any other hosting provider (or if you‚Äôre managing this on your own) should follow the ‚ÄúRedirects, and expected behavior from the hosting provider‚Äù section on the [initial RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34205).

If you're unit testing `gatsby-link` you'll need to update the `moduleNameMapper` option to include `gatsby-page-utils`, see [Unit Testing documentation](/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/#2-creating-a-configuration-file-for-jest) for more details.

The information presented here is also available in the [gatsby-config docs page](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/#trailingslash) and in the [PR #34268](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34268) that implemented this.

Please share your feedback and any issues you encounter directly into the [corresponding discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34205).

## Faster Schema Creation & `createPages`

We've seen a handful of sites struggling with long `schema building` and `createPages` steps. In this release, we've upgraded our external [`graphql-compose`](https://graphql-compose.github.io/) dependency to v9 to improve these steps by at least 30-50% for schemas/queries with many relationships. For example, one of our customers has seen improvements for `createPages` of 786s to 20s. This update is recommended to everyone and doesn't necessitate any changes on your end.

More information can be found in the [PR #34504](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/3504).
