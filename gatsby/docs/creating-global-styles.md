title: Creating Global Styles
---

Creating global styles for your Gatsby site depends on your [styling approach](/docs/styling/), so we've moved the instructions to the relevant guides:

- [Global styles with standard CSS files](/docs/how-to/styling/global-css/) (also applies if you're using CSS Modules for component-scoped styles)
- [Global styles with CSS-in-JS library Emotion](/docs/how-to/styling/emotion/)
- [Global styles with CSS-in-JS library Styled-Components](/docs/how-to/styling/styled-components/)
