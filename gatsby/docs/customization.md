title: Custom Configuration
---

Sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where Gatsby's default configuration just isn't quite what you need for your site. If you should find yourself in this situation, have no fear my friend, you can customize Gatsby's config for `babel` and `webpack`. You can also customize `html.js`, the React component used to generate the initial HTML file of your build. You'll also find guides on how to get custom environment variables into your website, as well how to proxy API requests in development so your API calls aren't interpreted by your server as static assets.
