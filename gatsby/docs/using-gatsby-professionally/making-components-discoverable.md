title: Making Components Discoverable
issue: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/14042
---

Code reuse is a useful advantage of the modularity provided by components. Discoverability is a key factor for sharing reusable components between developers and websites.

In larger organizations using Gatsby, it becomes more important for different teams to be able to browse components used by other teams, in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. Making components discoverable also helps in creating a component design system that helps keep your UX/UI consistent across websites and applications.

Shared components can be organized and made discoverable in a [shared component hub like bit.dev](https://bit.dev/components) to search, visualize, interact with and consume. Teams can share and discover components, use them in different projects, suggest updates and stay in sync.

If using additional repositories and libraries to share components, tools like [StoryBook](/docs/how-to/testing/visual-testing-with-storybook/) and [Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) can help develop and visualize components in isolation, creating a visual documentation portal for shared components.
