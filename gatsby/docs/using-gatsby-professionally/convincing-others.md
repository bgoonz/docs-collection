title: Convincing Others
---

This section of the documentation has a slightly different tenor than the rest of the docs.

The purpose of the rest of the docs is to help you understand Gatsby. The purpose of this section is to help you explain Gatsby to others.

Explaining Gatsby well to others, and helping convince them to use it (or to let you use it) is a different kind of problem than becoming a talented Gatsby developer.

It requires understanding what things those around you value, and helping them understand how Gatsby meets _their_ needs, rather than simply how Gatsby meets yours.

Gatsby is a transformative technology, and teams using Gatsby have the chance to radically improve the way they design, develop, and deploy websites. As you help others around you understand how Gatsby meets their needs, you facilitate their growth.
